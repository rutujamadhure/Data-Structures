As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Lauren Dillard, chief communications officer.\n\nLauren Dillard -- Chief Communications Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal '20 fourth-quarter and year-end results. With me today are Scott Howe, our CEO; and Warren Jenson, president and CFO; James Arra, president and chief commercial officer, will be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.\n\nToday's press release and this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a detailed description of these risks, please read the Risk Factors section of our public filings in the press release. A copy of our press release and financial schedules, including any reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures is available at liveramp.com. Also, during the call today, we will be referring to the slide deck posted on our website.\n\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me begin by saying we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. To say that we are in unprecedented times almost feels clich\u00e9, but we are, and the rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic will have far-reaching consequences for months and likely years to come.\n\nThis is a global time unlike any we have faced before. And we are responding by supporting our global employees, customers and partners, and community. Our first priority is always to our people, and I am incredibly proud of how seamlessly our 1,100 employees transitioned to working remote. We are providing our teams with the tools and resources they need to be productive and serve our customers in a work-from-home environment.\n\nWe are doubling down on employee communications, all-hands meetings and virtual events to ensure our people feel supported and connected to their teams. And we are soliciting and responding to employee feedback through ongoing surveys. We held a very successful virtual sales kickoff at the end of last month and have smoothly transitioned our ramp-up on the road events to a series of virtual summits. While it feels as though we haven't missed a beat, we also recognize this is a challenging time for our employees and their families.\n\nAnd I am so inspired by the resilience, grit, and customer obsession our teams have demonstrated. There are silver linings to be found in every crisis. And for LiveRamp, this period has served to strengthen the exceptional culture and character of our company. As a technology partner, we also have a duty to support all our customers and partners as they adjust to these challenging economic conditions by offering products and solutions that help their businesses become more resilient, efficient, and innovative.\n\nNow more than ever, it is important for brands to stay close to their customers and to demonstrate that their marketing investments are driving quantifiable business results. At LiveRamp, we remain committed to providing the critical infrastructure required for companies and their partners to connect, control, and activate data to deliver customer value and drive measurable return on investment. And finally, we have a commitment to our community. And in recent months, we have stepped up our data for good efforts to support organizations that are on the front lines.\n\nFor example, in mid-March, we launched a no-cost initiative to enable healthcare companies to use our products to recruit healthcare workers to telehealth platforms and to reach out to patients with personalized information in a time of national crisis. In addition, we are supporting a variety of local nonprofit organizations in the cities where we have offices. Before turning to the quarter, let me just acknowledge the efforts of all those who are working tirelessly to keep us safe and reopen the economy during this period. Thank you.\n\nA final but important thank you before I transition to discussing the business is to Bill Dillard, who, earlier today, announced he would retire from our board of directors when his term expires in August. Bill is a giant in the business world. As CEO and chairman of Dillard's, he runs one of the biggest retailers in North America. He has incredible business and financial intellect, and he has been a director for LiveRamp and, before that, Acxiom, for more than 30 years.\n\nIn my time as CEO, Bill has been a professional and personal mentor. He even took me to all the best Arkansan barbecue restaurants in my first year at Acxiom. He is amazing, and I can't thank him enough for his years of service. We've already started a search for Bill's board successor, and we're prioritizing SaaS expertise, operating experience, diversity, and deep understanding of the data ecosystem.\n\nSwitching gears now to the quarter. Amidst a challenging macro environment, I am pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by continued top-line execution and improving gross margin trends. Total revenue was $106 million, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue increased 28%, driven by strong usage of our platform to support more destinations and new use cases, including measurement, advanced TV, and second-party data collaboration.\n\nMarketplace and other revenue was up 71%, driven by a record data marketplace quarter. We saw strong growth in third-party data sales in Q4 to support advanced television targeting and our consumer social program. We also closed another solid bookings quarter, following record quarters in Q2 and Q3. Upsell bookings, in particular, were strong, and we had a number of nice safe haven wins, driving our average ACV up.\n\nEnding ARR grew 29% year over year, and our subscription and platform net expansion metrics were a healthy 110% and 122%, respectively. Beneath the top line, we generated significant gross margin leverage in the quarter and remained focused on driving further efficiencies across our entire cost base in the coming year. And finally, we continue to support our shareholders through our buyback. We took advantage of the recent pullback in our stock to pull forward our planned repurchases.\n\nAs a result, we opportunistically bought back over 100 million of stock since December 31. While we are very proud of our strong finish to FY '20, LiveRamp, along with most companies, will be impacted by the pandemic in FY '21. We are carefully monitoring leading indicators and key activity metrics, including pipeline, sales cycle length, conversion rates, contraction and product usage to assess the potential impact this year. We believe in the fundamental strength of our model but will feel pressure in certain areas.\n\nFor example, at the end of last quarter, we began to experience a higher trend in contraction among our smaller customers. This, in addition to some noncontrollable churn events, drove the deceleration in net customer adds in Q4. That said, we are actively pursuing a handful of initiatives to ensure we are delivering world-class customer experience during this time. We recently released several enhancements to our UI and also made significant improvements in reliability and turnaround times, reducing the average turnaround time by as much as 40% in recent months.\n\nWe have also streamlined our customer support structure to get customers faster, higher-quality responses. We are also watching our variable and data marketplace revenue closely. In line with what others in the space are reporting, year-over-year marketplace growth, although positive, trended lower in April as certain advertisers paused campaign spend. However, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization in May.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the macro environment will present some headwinds for our industry and business, we also know that circumstances like these, often bring opportunities. And in the coming months and quarters, we will play from a position of strength by leveraging three core competitive advantages: one, the growing importance of our value proposition; two, our durable business model; and three, our exceptionally strong balance sheet. Let me briefly address each in turn. First, we have an attractive and increasingly important value prop for our customers and partners in this environment.\n\nWhile we would never claim to be immune to the global pullback in advertising, we are fortunate to benefit from the secular wave toward data-driven, performance-based marketing. As budgets shift from above the line to below line, we play a critical role when helping our customers spend smarter and demonstrate clear return on investment. Our product suite and, in particular, solutions like ATS, advanced TV, and Safe Haven helps to ensure every marketing dollar spent is addressable, accountable, and measurable. We continue to experience strong global traction with the authenticated traffic solution or ATS.\n\nIt feels like the industry is rallying around ATS as the solution for a post-cookie world, and we've seen a nice uptick in recent adoption. We currently have 18 SSPs live with or implementing ATS, and we were excited to recently go live with InMobi, our first mobile SSP. On the demand side, we have 35 DSPs bidding on IDL or in the process of implementing, including Amobee, Beeswax, Criteo, and MediaMath. And perhaps most validating is the recent global publisher momentum we've generated.\n\nWe now have people-based integrations with over 30% of the Comscore 50, and have publishers on board in the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Continuing to evangelize and drive adoption of ATS will remain a top priority in the coming year. We know this is an area of interest for many of you. So we have included additional resources on our website and plan to host another ATS-focused investor webinar in June.\n\nNext, we believe the last two months have significantly accelerated our opportunity in advanced television. If there were ever to be a tipping point for data-driven television, we are witnessing it. With live sports canceled and the traditional upfronts canceled or postponed, we are seeing a sharp shift in activity to regional buying and CTV, both of which have the opportunity to be data-driven and addressable. Our CTV-related revenues were, again, very strong in the quarter.\n\nAnd our total advanced television business was up well in excess of 50%. As the economy begins to gradually reopen and as TV advertisers reengage, targeting, and in particular, regional targeting and measurement will become more important than ever. We are uniquely positioned to help these advertisers find targeted audiences across addressable television and streaming platforms and measure how those campaigns are driving business outcomes with Data Plus Math. The dramatic shift to streaming and in particular, AVOD streaming services during this time also presents an interesting opportunity for us to help brands find cord cutters and cord nevers where they are now consuming television.\n\nFinally, our Safe Haven solution has also generated tremendous global interest since its official launch this year. The current environment has spurred a moment for the industry to pause and reflect on its current strategies and practices. And as a result, many retailers are looking for ways to modernize their tech stack, which is exactly where Safe Haven comes in. I will let Warren share more on our progress in this area in a moment.\n\nAs Safe Haven was really born out of the innovative work we have been doing internationally with Carrefour and several other leading brands under Warren's leadership, while no one can predict exactly when we will see a recovery or what it will look like, what we do know is that data-driven advertising has an important role to play today, and an even bigger one as advertisers begin to strategize how they emerge on the other side of this pandemic. Second, we have a durable business model and diversified customer base. In recent quarters, there has been some debate around whether LiveRamp is true SaaS or ad tech. We hope our performance during this period serves to take that debate off the table.\n\nWhile peers in the ad tech space are forecasting sharp year-over-year revenue declines, we are forecasting growth. LiveRamp is enterprise SaaS, and we generate recurring subscription revenue, approximately 80% of our revenue comes from subscription contracts and more than 70% of our committed revenue or RPO is tied to multiyear deals. This provides us more stability than most as we navigate this period. We are also fortunate to have a diversified customer base with approximately 780 direct subscription customers, expanding a variety of verticals and geographies.\n\nExposure to the most impacted industries, like travel, hospitality, and entertainment, is highly manageable. And for these customers, we are developing a series of hit-the-ground-running packages, designed to help ready their data and capabilities for a quick restart when the economy stabilizes. Finally, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet. With more than $700 million in cash and no debt at year-end, we are fortunate to have the flexibility to continue to invest in product innovation and our key growth initiatives while also making bold investments to secure our future growth.\n\nIn the coming year, we intend to aggressively invest in the continued platformization of our infrastructure in our key future growth initiatives like television and Safe Haven. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to explore smart and strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Like the partnership we announced with Comscore a couple of weeks ago, which we believe is a game-changer for outcome-based television measurement. This preferred partnership provides customers access to Comscore's unified television viewership data, spending tens of millions of addressable households for outcome-based measurement through Data Plus Math and additional activation and measurement use cases through Safe Haven.\n\nIn short, it means that an advertiser running an advanced television campaign now has even more options available for measurement, segment creation, and understanding business outcomes. We are very excited to team up with Comscore to bring these combined capabilities to market. To conclude, I'll end where I began. We are in unprecedented times, and we expect this pandemic to have lasting effects on how companies do business now and in the future.\n\nBut as Warren and I have often said, data usage is only growing in importance. During periods of great uncertainty, leaders lead, and we will navigate the coming months and quarters from a position of strength. We play a critical role in helping companies deliver relevant and meaningful experiences to consumers. We have a set of products designed to deliver immediate value to customers by enabling their marketing spend to be addressable, accountable, and measurable.\n\nWe have a recurring subscription business model, diverse customer base, and a strong balance sheet which provides us flexibility to drive innovation and invest for long-term growth. And importantly, we have a nimble and resilient culture and a team of global LiveRampers who are up for the challenge. With that, thanks again for joining us today, and a big thank you to our exceptional customers, partners, and employees for their ongoing support and hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before jumping in, I, too, would like to thank our associates for their awesome work over the last several weeks. I feel fortunate to work with such great people.\n\nI also hope that all is well for each of you and your families. I'd like to focus my remarks today on four areas: first, briefly talk about Q4, highlighting the strength of our position going into this downturn; next, share a few performance highlights from April and the first two weeks of May, in other words, what we're seeing right now, then share a few high-level observations about FY '21; and finally, our Q1 guidance. Q4 results, LiveRamp's position of strength. Please turn to Slide 4.\n\nWell, in short, we entered this crisis with considerable momentum and from a position of strength. Almost every critical metric was up close to or over 30%. Q4 revenue was up 35%, subscription revenue, up 28%. Bookings grew by 31%.\n\nCurrent RPO or our next 12-month backlog was up 29%. And ARR ended the year up 29%. And notably, marketplace was up 71%, driven by the strength of our performance in TV. Net retention was 110% and platform net retention was a strong 122%.\n\nOur growth initiatives are on a roll in setting the pace for innovation globally. LiveRamp Safe Haven. Earlier this year, we launched our Safe Haven platform, and we've been winning globally. This calendar year, we've entered into Safe Haven partnerships with over 10 leading global brands, including another top five U.S.\n\nretailer, one of the largest pharma companies in the world; carwow, the leading online automotive marketplace in the U.K.; and MiQ, a programmatic media platform in China. In addition, TV had a standout quarter. TV-related revenues were up over 70% year over year. Operationally, it was also a great quarter as our gross margin exceeded 70% for the first time as a stand-alone business.\n\nWe have now fully absorbed our extra public company infrastructure costs. Interestingly, in the U.S., our gross margin was 73%, which is very close to our long-term model commitment. Our operating loss was $16 million. As part of our year-end close, we scrubbed our balance sheet and added approximately $3.5 million in incremental bad debt reserves to cover potential COVID-related challenges.\n\nOf our total expenses, approximately $10 million was largely onetime in nature. And lastly, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet. Our cash balance was $718 million, and we have no debt. We've been through our receivables with a fine-tooth comb, and we feel our exposures are appropriately reserved.\n\nWe were careful over the last few months, but at the same time, we're opportunistic with our buyback. And as a result, we took the opportunity to front-end load our FY '21 repurchases. Calendar year to date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares for total consideration of $103 million. Since inception of our buyback, we have returned approximately $1.2 billion to our shareholders.\n\nIn summary, we ended FY '20 in an incredibly strong position. We are in the middle of a powerful secular growth curve and have a great set of customers, employees, and products. Our lagging and leading performance metrics are strong, and our products are winning. We are helping to power this secular trend toward outcome-driven advertising and addressability.\n\nAnd finally, we have a balance sheet that is the envy of the industry. But as we all know, that was then. So what are we seeing now? For the next several minutes, I'll focus my comments on three areas. First, metrics.\n\nWhat are the numbers telling us? Next, what have we done to manage the crisis and ensure we will lead and win in economic recovery? And finally, share our perspective on FY '21 and provide guidance for Q1. Metrics. What are the numbers telling us? Please turn to Slide 13, Industry Concentration and Customer Concessions. First, we are SaaS.\n\nAnd as a result, our revenues are highly durable. As this chart shows, our client mix is also diverse. As you would expect, we have worked with our customers who have been severely impacted. For those customers, in some cases, we have temporarily paused our service and billing for a short period of time, usually about three months.\n\nTypically, that accommodation has also included a contract extension. To date, concessions have been highly manageable and have totaled about 4 million revenue and have been factored into the guidance we will share later on this call. In summary, our client mix is diverse, and our SaaS revenue is resilient. And while things could always change, customer concessions have been manageable.\n\nApril results, please turn to Slide 14. In short, we grew. Subscription, marketplace, and ARR all improved year over year. We continue to win and close business.\n\nFurther, we have seen no deterioration in the records being uploaded into our platform. In fact, our volumes indexed against the first 10 weeks of the calendar year were up in April and for the first two weeks of May. However, the usage portion of our subscription revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue did decline compared to the prior year. Typically, the variable portion has averaged between 10% and 15% of total subscription revenue.\n\nFor the month of April and the first two weeks of May, variable is averaging low to mid-single digits. As a percentage of total subscription revenue. Net, while down as a percentage of revenue, we continue to see usage from customers in excess of their committed minimums. Before talking about our approach to and outlook for FY '21, I'd like to share a few of the challenges we are seeing.\n\nWhile we are obviously thrilled with the resiliency of our platform and the reception of our products, we would be the last to argue that our business is not being impacted by the downturn. It has been and is. Specifically, we would highlight that we have seen pipeline push out. Make no mistake, we're still closing deals, but deal cycles are extending.\n\nNext, we expect our net new customer adds to slow considerably as a result of higher churn and fewer new deals closing in this environment. We felt some of this pressure in late March. It is conceivable that we may have a quarter where our net adds are flat to down. We expect our results internationally to continue to be pressured.\n\nNext, we expect our retention metrics to be pressured for the reasons mentioned above, and it's very possible that there will be more requests to put our service on hold, particularly in industries where recovery will lag. In summary, we feel very fortunate to be the category creator and innovator in a business which is benefiting from a powerful secular trend. We are Switzerland, and the industry needs a neutral identity infrastructure, our products drive real results. This is more important than ever during this critical time.\n\nWe're SaaS, and the resiliency of our subscription business is clear. And finally, we are clearly feeling -- while we are clearly feeling the impact of macro forces, we have and are managing the impact. In short, we are still growing. I would now like to spend a minute and share our approach to the macro challenges.\n\nAs many of you know, I was Amazon's CFO in the company's early days. 20 years ago, the markets and press turned on Amazon, pretty sure it was The Wall Street Journal who came out with the headline, Amazon.bomb, the stock went to $7. That said, Amazon had a unique advantage and challenge. Its customers love the service, but the company was bleeding hundreds of millions, and absent change was a goner.\n\nIt seems hard to believe today, but true. History now tells the rest. In those start days, Amazon became free cash flow positive but simultaneously drove massive innovation. Used goods were sold next to new.\n\nThe company entered into platform joint ventures with Toys \"R\" Us and Target. And as a result, the origins of AWS were seeded. Its fulfillment centers became an asset as third-party merchants could use Amazon's infrastructure and sell next to Amazon's owned inventory. What seldom discussed though was how buttoned-up Amazon became.\n\nIn short order, every operational process got good. My words, Amazon got control of the knobs, really, really fast. And 20 years later, the rest is history. So what have we been up to at LiveRamp? As the world around has changed, our leadership team gathered virtually in mid-March and set some objectives and guardrails for replanning the company's coming months and quarters.\n\nSpecifically, we would protect the health and well-being of our employees and our company's culture, delight our customers, and focus on their needs, deal with the new realities and move quickly to take action. And finally, take steps to ensure we would protect our business in the short term, but also win in recovery. Specifically, on the top line, double down on new initiatives like ATS, TV, and Safe Haven. And on the bottom line, tighten up our operational processes to accelerate our drive toward operational excellence, profitability, and margin expansion.\n\nPlease turn to Slide 16. This page summarizes the financials associated with eight weeks of focused planning and activity across every function of LiveRamp. We built detailed plans for accelerating our investments in ATS, TV, Safe Haven, and B2B. These investments will mostly show up in R&D.\n\nNext, we have built strategies to boost productivity in every functional area of the company. As an example, as a result of changing work practices, we don't intend to add any new lease space this coming year. We have also retooled our quote-to-cash practices. And where we had opportunity, we went after reducing discretionary spend.\n\nIn short, we're excited and leaning in. We have protected innovation and are doubling down on some big opportunities, and at the same time, have dramatically brought in our profitability time line. I'd like to close by summarizing our thoughts on FY '21 and then provide specific guidance for Q1. Please turn to Slide 15.\n\nWhile we don't intend to give traditional full-year guidance, we wanted to summarize the positives, the challenges and the likely implications. Our net takeaways are on the right. Secular trends are in our favor. We expect FY '21 will be a growth year, albeit modest.\n\nGiven what we see today, we expect meaningful profit improvement and manageable cash burn. Our balance sheet and liquidity are secure. And finally, the importance of our platform and products puts us in a great position to win and accelerate in economic recovery. For Q1, we expect revenue of approximately $88 million and a non-GAAP operating loss of up to $12 million.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this guidance excludes intangibles, stock-based compensation, and restructuring and related charges. A few other call-outs. In Q1, our guidance is intended to be conservative, but it is also appropriate. Given the sequential decline in revenue, we would expect gross margin to be down sequentially.\n\nWe expect approximately $6 million of restructuring and related spend and $1 million of capex. Finally, for the year, a few additional items. Buyback. Given the market dislocation, we purposely front end-loaded our repurchases.\n\nTherefore, we do not expect to be in the market for the remainder of the calendar year. That said, we will not hesitate to be opportunistic should circumstances warrant. Note that during the year, we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately $30 million as a result of being able to carry back our FY '20 tax losses. Other full-year guidance items have been included on Slide '19.\n\nBefore opening the call to questions, I'll close with a few final thoughts. First, again, a huge thank you to our customers and employees. It is you who make this company great. Next, we are approaching the coming months and quarters from a position of considerable strength.\n\nWe are SaaS and our revenues are resilient. We sit at the center of a strong secular trend and have taken steps to deliver a solid top and bottom-line performance through the downturn and are investing and tightening to ensure we lead in recovery too. It's a great time to be at LiveRamp. With that, operator, we will open the call to questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got one for Scott, one for Warren. Scott, I'd be curious just to hear a little bit more of the nuance on your conversations with clients if we can sort of remove the effect of the pandemic if that's possible.\n\nAnd what the tone of conversations is with clients around some of the key issues that were driving adoption of your products previously, including, obviously, the challenges to third-party cookies and particularly the notice that a lot more people tended to take once Chrome made their announcement regarding that. So I'd love to just hear what the conversation is broadly around where those priorities still lie. And then, Warren, I understand the fiscal '21 guidance of albeit modest growth, I guess when we see that and compare it against the plus 14% in April, I guess it's fair to say that where some of these negatives around, especially, say, pipeline, pushing out in some concessions are driving something that we would expect to be below the April rate. Is that how we should take modest to be? Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Dan, it's Scott. I'll start but also invite James. James Arra is on the call with us as well, and so he can probably provide some real anecdotal color around what I'm about to say. So what I would tell you is there is a real headwind from COVID, but also a real silver lining.\n\nAnd certainly, the economy is in a different period, different state than it was just three short months ago. And we absolutely work with some clients who are hard hit by that. Travel, retail, automotive, they have been hard hit, and you can see it in, in particular, their television investments, their broadcast television investments. I mean, they really pulled back.\n\nBut within that backdrop, I think all of our clients have found that they have a little bit of breathing room to stop and think as opposed to just execute, execute, execute. And so the conversations around third-party cookie deprecation and their response have certainly accelerated. We especially see that from publishers. I think there was kind of a misperception in the industry that the authenticated traffic solution was a replacement for third-party cookies.\n\nNow it's not an or. It's an and. That even before third-party cookies go away, publishers who embrace ATS can make what was 40% of their inventory that was previously unaddressable through Safari or Firefox, they can actually lock in significantly higher yields, I mean, 20% more. And so as a result, those conversations have really found wings.\n\nOur direct clients also, as they think about what spend remains and what additional spend they'll activate as they come out of the recession, they're really focused on measurability and ROI, and those two characteristics really play to our strengths. So we were talking earlier, we tend to be the last one to leave and the first one back, meaning that when clients turn off their efforts. The direct accountable stuff is the last thing that they'll ever want to touch, and it's the first thing that they want to reactivate coming out of a downturn. And so that spurred additional conversations for us and things like connected television, where clients realize there's no upfront, behavior has shifted in-home behind screens and the only way to reach young people is through connected television, the likes which we can provide.\n\nMoreover, because we have a data set that allows them to buy far more granularly than GRPs or TRPs, they can actually target their audience more effectively. So a lot of good opportunities for us to go mine in this downturn.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd then, Dan, the higher...\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nDan, this is...\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nJames, go ahead.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nSure. Thanks, Warren. Dan, just to give you some client anecdotes because clearly, the COVID shutdown is having an impact that no one could have predicted a few months ago. But our conversations with our clients have always been around two primary themes, and that's addressability and measurability.\n\nAnd the interesting thing we saw at the end of last quarter and then even in April is if we are seeing some pipeline push, we're also seeing some of our companies look to this as an opportunity to really think about what to do once they're out of the COVID shutdown. And there's two examples I want to give you. One is with a fantasy sports platform. And we thought, for sure, our deal at the end of last quarter would be dead in the water.\n\nBut we were able to show them that once we get through this period, here's all the things they need to do. And they ended up signing a deal at the end of the quarter, so we were really pleased with that. And that's an example of a company thinking about what happens after the shutdown. And another one is in the QSR space.\n\nWe signed a new logo deal, a seven-figure deal with one of the major QSR companies out there. And they're clearly not as impacted by the COVID period, but they are using this as an opportunity to really think about the strategy and think about how to drive to more of a data-driven approach, how to drive to more measurability and more addressability. So there's certainly a lot of silver linings in what's happening. And we really believe strongly, we're well-positioned to help our customers through the recession and to really recession-proof their businesses.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Dan, this is Warren. Let me chat a little bit about our guidance. First, let me just start off by saying we were incredibly pleased by what we saw in April and the resiliency of our business across the board. As you would expect, however, we, like you, were watching everything very, very carefully, and, in particular, wanting the variable portion of subscription revenue and marketplace.\n\nSo what about our guidance? A couple of things I want to mention. First, as I did in my prepared remarks, we intended our guidance to be conservative. And let me just kind of put another phrase around that. We wanted to give you guidance you can take to the bank.\n\nAnd I'm going to mention three things. First of all, overall, revenues will be up for the year. Subscription revenue will be up for the year, and we expect profitability improvement. So again, we fully intended the guidance to be conservative, be conservative.\n\nAnd secondly, guidance you can take to the bank.\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open now.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. Hey, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for taking my questions. First one for me, the Connected TV business, we're certainly hearing a lot about it in the industry news with the upfronts going away, as you mentioned. How are you thinking about this business? And whether this really could -- the COVID, as terrible as the whole thing is, maybe this could be a massive shift that finally pushes the whole industry away from the legacy way in which TV advertising was bought and really push it to this connected TV and digital buying.\n\nAnd then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Stan, it's Scott. So Connected TV for us was up very, very strongly in Q4, and we expect it to have another very strong double-digit growth year in FY '21. I do think this is as close to a tipping point as we'll see.\n\nThings are starting to move. I think the first harbinger for us is just the sheer number of client conversations that we fielded. And yes, it's picked up, perhaps in the last couple of months. However, these were strong over the last six to eight months that this trend was already coming.\n\nThe other thing that I mentioned briefly in my prepared remarks, but one of the advantages that we have as a company right now is we do feel like we have a really strong balance sheet. And that's going to allow us to be very strategic in commercial deals as well. And so one of the things we announced in the last couple of weeks was our deal with Comscore. In the television space, there are kind of two things that really matter: number one is addressability, the ability to identify who's living behind a set-top box, and that's something that we've long prided ourselves on the ability to do, but the other piece of that is viewership.\n\nWhat are they watching? And through the Comscore commercial deal that they announced on their earnings call a couple of weeks ago, we have licensed viewership data for a really significant number of households. I mean, when you talk about both set-top box and connected television, we are talking upwards of 80 million or 90 million devices. So that really, I think, allows us to bring scale to the conversations we have and really offer a compelling value proposition to our advertisers. So all this to say we're really excited about what's to come here.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And then just a follow-up. On the expansion and -- well, actually, I guess the flip side -- the contraction, rather, that you're seeing within your existing customers, maybe help us to break it down between the 22% of your ARR that's really coming from these heavily impacted industries and what you're seeing there. Is the contraction there, is it like full stop, we're stopping everything? Or is it maybe just a slight pullback? And then the other 78% of your business and what the contraction looks like on the other side.\n\nThat's it for me. Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJames, do you want to...\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nStan, this is James. Yes. I'll go ahead and take this. So let me start by saying Q4 was a really good quarter, and as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, it was our third-largest bookings quarter ever.\n\nAnd similar to other quarters for FY '20, roughly 65-ish percent of that was an upsell, so we are still seeing significant growth within our customer base. Now what we experienced toward the end of Q4 and what we're being very cautious of in our guidance for FY '21 is we did see a number of very small clients, sub-$50,000-a-year clients pull back, and we saw churn from there. The other thing we saw was some noncontrollable churn. There was some major acquisitions that have happened where both of our clients, both side to our clients.\n\nSo we saw that impact to a certain extent and then some bankruptcies and some nonpayment. We saw that tick up quite substantially in Q4 as well. So all that being said, we're always looking for ways we can provide more value to our customers, and we'll continue to do that. And we've always said that that churn is an opportunity for us.\n\nAnd we're really looking for ways that we can continue to drive more value. Now the COVID impact specific to the 22% that we outlined, there, what we are seeing is them ask for concessions, and we're being a good partner. And we recognize that they're going through some very, very tough times right now, and we're working with them as they shut things down right now. But we don't view this as a situation for the companies that survive this, and we think many of our customers will.\n\nWe don't necessarily view that COVID shutdown as a churn event. In fact, just earlier today, a major hotel chain that two months ago, had asked us to pause because they were shutting down everything and furloughing employees. They came back to us today and said, they're starting back up. We were expecting the conversation to be, hey, we're going to need another month or we're going to do another two months, and it was the opposite.\n\nThey're already gearing up for the reopening. So we're viewing that as a really positive sign.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nThanks, guys. I wanted to drill down just a little bit more on the mechanics of that lower usage. Is it fewer campaigns, fewer segments, customers using fewer touchpoints, or just the impact of, to your point, clients who are pulling back very hard on advertising? And any broad trends or themes to tease out there, how quickly you see that bouncing back as we exit? Thanks.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nWell, yes, I'll start. And then Warren, why don't you weigh in with some of the macro metrics that we're seeing. So for the customers that have requested a pause and really, this is a concession that we're giving. It's really due to the fact that they've either completely shut off all marketing and, in many situations, have furloughed employees because of the shutdown, where there's just no reason for them to be spending that money.\n\nBut we're staying engaged with these customers. We're being a good partner. And what we're also doing is we're helping them build their start-up plans. So Scott mentioned this in his remarks as well.\n\nOnce we get out of sort of COVID-shutdown mode, there is going to be a meaningful recession. And we strongly believe we can help our customers through recession because budgets are going to be constrained and what they're going to need to maximize the value they get out of every marketing dollar they spend. And the way they do that is through measurability and addressability. And that's the areas that we really help them with.\n\nSo for many of these customers that are on pause, we're staying engaged. We're working with them on their plans for how to restart and what they should focus on. And we believe that will help them and will help us accelerate out of this very quickly.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nA couple of things, Brian, that I'd mentioned that are also -- I guess one thing very specific to the numbers and then a couple of things anecdotally. It was really interesting. A large global consumer brand that spends, I don't know how many hundreds, if not billions, of dollars on advertising came to us about 30 days ago, and they said, \"We have pulled back 80% of our advertising globally, but we have also made the decision that when we come back, we are going to come back with 100% addressability.\" So we are working with this brand on putting them in a position to do exactly that. And that's the sort of thing that we're seeing from our customers.\n\nThe second thing is that, obviously, as it comes to usage for April and for the first two weeks of May, we said low to mid-single digits, so call it, 4% or 5%. So it is down from 10% to 15%, but it's still positive and would argue, at least for now, it's certainly, certainly stable. And then one other interesting specific. In terms of the concessions we've given to people, as I noted in the call, and I'll just repeat it.\n\nTypically, they're 30 to 90 days. And then also, for the vast majority of those, we also extended our clients so -- or extended our contracts. So it was very much just a pause. And over -- I think, James, wasn't it over 70% of those requests came in the first 10 days or so of April? So this was very much front end-loaded, and we just have not seen any kind of volume like that over the course of really, the last four weeks.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYeah, that's exactly right.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nThanks, James. Thanks, Warren. Thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for all the transparency and color. I wanted to ask a few questions or a couple of questions around the marketplace business. It seems like it's trending much better than what we've seen for programmatic spend.\n\nAnd I was just curious why you think that is. And when you look at just the programmatic display portion of that business, are you seeing any changes in terms of data elements per campaign, less uses there? And then, Warren, in your fiscal-year expectations, just in your base case, how are you thinking about just the marketplace line? Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo Shyam, it's Scott. First off, on the marketplace business. Remember that if you think about the customers of our data marketplace business, it's actually fairly broad. Yes, we work with direct brands, but we also work with some of the large platform and tech providers.\n\nAnd importantly, when they're ingesting data through our data marketplace, they're using it to enhance their own products. So it's not just for programmatic. It can be for programmatic. It can be for television.\n\nBut in many cases, it's even more broad than that. I think there's going to be a real benefit in the coming year for us with television because to the extent that an advertiser feels that just buying thin demographic sets on broadcast television that no one's watching anymore is kind of a tired approach. Well, they can actually utilize Data Plus Math to go find a much more granular audience, so we think that will be an enabler for that business over time. That said, it is the one area because it's variable, much of it is not subscription that we think will be most impacted by the recession, and so we put in place a conservative forecast.\n\nIn terms of the data elements that people are buying the mix, it's not something I know off the top of my head, but we'll look at that and let you know. I mean, we certainly have good line of sight to that.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd then in terms of our guidance or just our outlook for the year, I'd probably just repeat a little bit of what Scott said. We're, again, very pleased by what we've seen in April and what we've seen, really, month to date in May. That said, just given all the uncertainty, this is one of the areas that we're watching throughout the year. And we've tried to be appropriately conservative in our internal outlook such that we rightsize everything, but at the same time, we're optimistic but also cautious.\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Your line is open.\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Scott, you mentioned that ATS was causing some of your constituents to rally around as kind of a solution in a post-cookie world. Could you talk about what you've seen geographically? I know there are other countries that have higher exposure to Safari and Firefox. I was wondering if that was a good kind of leading indicator for what we would expect from the rest of the world going forward.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, Warren runs our international business. Do you want to talk about that?\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nGo ahead and jump in. I'll follow-up.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. I mean, in my prepared remarks, I talked about just this, the traction we have gotten outside the U.S. I think we've signed double-digit international publishers in the last quarter as an example. And in certain markets, particularly in Europe and much of Asia, this is the only solution for publishers.\n\nI mean, they have even more stringent privacy regulations that they need to navigate. And so it's just so important that they go out and rather than rely on someone else to sit as the intermediary and potentially disintermediate them, that they collect their own authentications, their own consents. Any publisher who has compelling content is already offering a value exchange, and it's just making it from being an implicit value exchange to explicit. And as soon as they do that, as soon as they collect those consents and literally upload a wider code on their page to benefit from ATS, then they can start to generate significant advantages and monetization.\n\nOur initial tests have suggested that could be 20% or more. And obviously, in markets that have the most adoption of Safari and Firefox or the most exposure to Chrome, the yield is going to be even greater and the urgency to adopt something like ATS will increase. So as a result, a lot of traction. I think the biggest challenge for us is how to evangelize that without getting on airplanes, but our team has done a really great job of hosting vid con sessions, webinars, and we have a lot of content on our site if you're interested in learning more.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nKyle, let me add a couple of things to what Scott said that really excites us from an international and global perspective. I'd just remind everybody that ATS is not a U.S. thing, it's a global thing. So it is truly a global product offering for LiveRamp.\n\nAnd when you think about our acceleration in recovery, this really globalizes our company much, much more quickly. We have momentum with ATS in Japan. We have momentum with ATS in Australia. We have momentum in Italy and Germany, France, U.K.\n\nand keep going, in Spain. So this is a global phenomenon, and it is a global phenomenon with brands. Many of the largest advertisers in the world, again, are not simply U.S. companies.\n\nThey're global companies. And they want uniform addressability in every single market in which they operate, and that's a very, very positive thing for us. The second thing that I'd note for everybody that has had time to sit down and work with us and hear about what we're doing with our Safe Haven platform. ATS and Safe Haven are very natural partners, and they're natural partners for brands and their natural partners for publishers, which, again, accelerates our opportunity.\n\nAnd again, when you think about Safe Haven, it just revolutionizes how companies collaborate. And it was also built in a privacy-first way. It was built for GDPR. So the combination of those two things, really, we believe, speak.\n\nAnd in fact, the results are showing it, bode well for us globally over not only the near term but also very much so as the world moves on from this crisis.\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that is all the time that we have for questions. I turn the call back to Warren Jenson for any closing remarks.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, operator. And again, a huge thank you to everyone for joining us today. And most importantly, I'd like to repeat something I said in my prepared remarks, just a huge thank you to our customers and our employees.\n\nIt's you who make this company great. I'd like to conclude with, I guess, just a few thoughts as you think about the year ahead and what we've talked about today. We will grow in FY '21, and our subscription revenue will grow in FY '21. When we think about momentum in the near term and we think about momentum and recovery, our products are winning, whether it's TV, whether it's Safe Haven, whether it's ATS.\n\nWe believe we've given you guidance that you can take to the bank with profitability improvement. And then as always, for everyone, just as we've done this past year, we will be highly strategic with our capital. And let me put it this way. In the near term, and on anything discretionary, we will be very stringy, but also, we intend to be very strategic.\n\nSo with that, thank you all very much for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you over the coming days. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\nDuration: 65 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nLauren Dillard -- Chief Communications Officer\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nMore RAMP analysis\n\nAll earnings call transcripts"}, "News 3": {"title": "Does LiveRamp Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE:RAMP), then you might want to consider its beta (a measure of share price volatility) in order to understand how the stock could impact your portfolio. Volatility is considered to be a measure of risk in modern finance theory. Investors may think of volatility as falling into two main categories. The first category is company specific volatility. This can be dealt with by limiting your exposure to any particular stock. The second type is the broader market volatility, which you cannot diversify away, since it arises from macroeconomic factors which directly affects all the stocks on the market.\n\nSome stocks see their prices move in concert with the market. Others tend towards stronger, gentler or unrelated price movements. Some investors use beta as a measure of how much a certain stock is impacted by market risk (volatility). While we should keep in mind that Warren Buffett has cautioned that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk', beta is still a useful factor to consider. To make good use of it you must first know that the beta of the overall market is one. Any stock with a beta of greater than one is considered more volatile than the market, while those with a beta below one are either less volatile or poorly correlated with the market.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for LiveRamp Holdings\n\nWhat we can learn from RAMP's beta value\n\nZooming in on LiveRamp Holdings, we see it has a five year beta of 1.27. This is above 1, so historically its share price has been influenced by the broader volatility of the stock market. If this beta value holds true in the future, LiveRamp Holdings shares are likely to rise more than the market when the market is going up, but fall faster when the market is going down. Many would argue that beta is useful in position sizing, but fundamental metrics such as revenue and earnings are more important overall. You can see LiveRamp Holdings's revenue and earnings in the image below.\n\nNYSE:RAMP Income Statement May 21st 2020 More\n\nCould RAMP's size cause it to be more volatile?\n\nWith a market capitalisation of US$2.5b, LiveRamp Holdings is a pretty big company, even by global standards. It is quite likely well known to very many investors. It takes a lot of money to influence the share price of large companies like this one. That makes it interesting to note that its share price has a history of sensitivity to market volatility. There might be some aspect of the business that means profits are leveraged to the economic cycle.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nSince LiveRamp Holdings tends to move up when the market is going up, and down when it's going down, potential investors may wish to reflect on the overall market, when considering the stock. In order to fully understand whether RAMP is a good investment for you, we also need to consider important company-specific fundamentals such as LiveRamp Holdings\u2019s financial health and performance track record.

Our product suite, and in particular the Authenticated Traffic Solution\u00ae (or ATS), Safe Haven\u00ae and Advanced TV products, ensure every marketing dollar spent is addressable, accountable and measurable.\"\n\n\"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the entire LiveRamp team for the resiliency and exceptionalism they have demonstrated during this period,\" added Howe. \"In times of adversity, the true character of a team emerges, and I could not be more proud to lead this incredible group of people.\"\n\nCOVID-19 Business Update\n\n\"LiveRamp, along with most companies, is being impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. That said, we are fortunate to be operating from a position of strength,\" said LiveRamp President and CFO Warren Jenson. \"In addition to our robust balance sheet, we have great customers, dedicated employees, a subscription business model and products that benefit from the secular wave toward outcome-based marketing and advertising. However, we are watching and monitoring our business closely, and in particular, usage trends and our Data Marketplace.\"\n\nLiveRamp has taken proactive steps to keep its employees safe and global customer base serviced during these unprecedented times:\n\nIn early March, LiveRamp, in coordination with local government guidance, began implementing its Pandemic Plan for staged movement to work from home in order to protect its workforce.

LiveRamp is, however, dependent on its cloud infrastructure and the ability for its workforce to work remotely. To date, service to customers and partners has continued uninterrupted.\n\nLiveRamp\u2019s balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with over $700 million of cash and no debt at year-end. The company is carefully managing working capital, tightening its hiring practices and reducing costs where appropriate.\n\nThe company increased its reserves for bad debts during the fourth quarter by approximately $3.5 million in response to increased future collection risk associated with certain customer segments.\n\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Results\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ($ in millions):\n\nQ4 Fiscal 2020 Full Year Fiscal 2020 Results Results GAAP Non-GAAP GAAP Non-GAAP Subscription revenue $84 \u2014 $306 \u2014 YoY change % 28% 29% Marketplace & other revenue $22 \u2014 $75 \u2014 YoY change % 71% 53% Total revenue $106 \u2014 $381 \u2014 YoY change % 35% 33% Gross profit $69 $75 $228 $253 % Gross margin 65% 71% 60% 67% YoY change, pts 13pts 11pts 2pts 1pts Operating loss ($41) ($16) ($181) ($64) % Operating margin (39%) (15%) (48%) (17%) YoY change, pts 66pts 14pts 22pts 2pts Net loss from continuing operations ($5) ($3) ($125) ($37) YoY change % nm nm nm nm Loss per share from continuing operations ($0.07) ($0.05) ($1.85) ($0.55) YoY change % nm nm nm nm Shares to Calculate EPS 67.0 67.0 67.8 67.8 YoY change % (2%) (2%) (10%) (10)% Net operating cash flow ($0) \u2014 ($29) \u2014 YoY change % nm \u2014 nm Free cash flow to equity \u2014 ($2) \u2014 ($40) YoY change % \u2014 nm \u2014 nm Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n\nA detailed discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the schedules to this press release.\n\nAdditional Business Metrics & Highlights\n\nLiveRamp added 10 net new direct subscription customers during the quarter, bringing its total direct customer count to 780, an increase of 17% year over year.

Platform net retention was 122% driven by strong Marketplace & Other trends.\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (RPO), which is contracted and committed revenue expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $221 million, up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThe company recently launched LiveRamp Safe Haven, a new platform that enables secure, permission-enabled data collaboration for brands and their partners. Two of the top five largest U.S. retailers are implementing Safe Haven, and to date, more than 35 companies world-wide are using this technology in their workflows.\n\nLiveRamp addressability solutions, including ATS, continue to experience strong global adoption. There are currently 18 supply-side platforms (SSPs) live or committed to implementing IdentityLink\u2122 in the bidstream, including OpenX, Index Exchange, Pubmatic, Rubicon Project and TripleLift. In addition, there are 35 demand-side platforms (DSPs) live or committed to bid on IdentityLink, including Amobee, Criteo, dataxu, and MediaMath. Lastly, to date, LiveRamp has signed on more than 45 publishers globally for ATS, spanning the US, UK, France, Spain, Italy, and Japan.\n\nBoard of Directors Update\n\nLiveRamp also announced today that William T. Dillard II is retiring from the LiveRamp Board of Directors when his current term ends at the next annual meeting of shareholders, expected to be held in August 2020. Mr. Dillard has been a trusted advisor during the company\u2019s evolution.\n\n\"Bill\u2019s guidance has been invaluable to LiveRamp, and I want to personally thank him for his decades of service to the company. Bill has brought a strong customer perspective plus a wealth of executive experience to LiveRamp. He was instrumental in transforming the company into a category-creating software business. Both the board and the leadership team are deeply appreciative of Bill\u2019s long service to LiveRamp,\" said Scott Howe.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nGiven uncertainties related to the rapidly changing global economic environment, LiveRamp is providing first quarter guidance only.\n\nLiveRamp\u2019s non-GAAP guidance excludes the impact of non-cash stock compensation, purchased intangible asset amortization, and restructuring and related charges.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2021, LiveRamp expects to report:\n\nRevenue of approximately $88 million, an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year.\n\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations of up to $47 million.\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of up to $12 million.\n\nConference Call\n\nLiveRamp will hold a conference call at 1:30 p.m. PT today to further discuss this information.

Mr. Huang, please go ahead.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Nick. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 results announcement. It is hard to believe that we're nearly halfway through the year, while COVID-19 has put a much of the world on a holding pattern since February, it has also resulted in a period of intense activity for many industries and the companies seeking to cope with such a unprecedented phenomenon.\n\nCOVID-19 has unleashed a powerful forces that are changing the way we live, work and play. It has compressed the years of the behavioral change and accelerated the adoption of online commerce at an unprecedented pace. Now, more than ever, people are relying on online platforms to meet not just their discretionary one, but for their critical need.\n\nFor a while e-commerce has crossed an important threshold and have become more integral to people's lives. This change also requires a lot of trust on the part of consumers, something that platforms must continue to work hard to earn. As a company, we made a deliberate decision to step up our support of our users and merchant community to help tide them over these challenging times.\n\nIn the near-term these initiatives might have been higher bandwidth costs, more cost to help offset the price increases for medical and household essentials or even more free traffic support for our mostly trusted merchants. But we make these decisions deliberately, because they are consistent with our corporate culture of the firm or doing the right things. These consciousness -- our conscious investments have built-in valuable trust with our users. People remember when you are there for them in their time of need.\n\nThe pandemic also unleashed another powerful force that after need for better ways to interact and socialize online. This need for the right digital tools has never been more important with the fusing of the physical and the virtual worlds, because people must now find the ways to do online what they used to do offline, whether it is going to office, shopping arm in arm at a retail mall, sharing popcorn at movies or having hard parts together. We have positioned ourselves to ride the convergence of these powerful forces. We design our platform to maximize social interaction by tapping our innate desire to connect and share.\n\nOur mission has never been more relevant or salient in these challenging times, which is to provide a fun and engaging environment for people to shop together and get the best value for their money. We know we are on the right track, because we crossed 600 million annual active users -- annual active buyers for the first time this past quarter. And our user engagement metrics continue to improve.\n\nOn how COVID-19 has changed the retail industry. So how has COVID-19 changed the retail industry and the e-commerce. What do these change mean for the company like Pinduoduo? Let me highlight three specific change; first, live streaming. With COVID-19, we realized that the boundaries between virtual and the physical worlds have blurred to an unprecedented degree. We launched our live streaming service in November last year and we have found it to be an effective tool in lowering the barriers to helping consumers overcome their aversion to buying certain product categories online. These categories include high-end jewelries such as pearls and jade, premium seafood like Argentine shrimp or live lobster or even farming equipments.\n\nWe see live streaming not only as a channel to sell products, but more importantly a value for merchants to share their personal experiences and interact with the users. Live streaming is a great way to showcase certain offline experience that otherwise unavailable to many of our users. For example, we organized the live streaming toward to seven major museums worldwide, while featuring select items from their representative gift shops. Through the live streaming, producers build trust with potential consumers by showcasing their work for how they pick food from their farms to how they pack the catch of the day or even how they make delicious meatballs by hand.\n\nLive streaming opens a window into the lives of producers and unfolds the story of the product in a way that a simple listing cannot. Live streaming also helps consumers to better appreciate and differentiate the products by having the merchant demonstrate the product and answering questions just like if one were shopping in the mall.\n\nThe second change is faster online-offline integration. We still see significant opportunity in combining the scale of our online traffic with offline retail experiences. In early May, we joined the forces with Shanghai government and the local enterprises to successfully organize the May 5 shopping festival. In five days we have to drive over RMB3.2 billion of online sales in the Shanghai area through 100 shopping malls, more than 78 million users enjoy the live streaming content produced by 1,136 PDD live streaming rooms in collaboration with CCTV. Users were able to enjoy consumer services for in-store salespeople.\n\nPinduoduo also sold over 600 cars in the first two hours of the festival in a partnership with Shanghai based SAIC Group. We partnered with Guomei to expedite the integration of the online and offline sales experience, home appliances and the consumer electronics product categories where delivery installation and after-sales services are important part of the purchase consideration. Guomei's nationwide retail network would play a crucial role in a part of the sales process and we're working together to redesign the shopping experience.\n\nThe third change relates to helping exporters pivot to the domestic consumer market. Due to the worldwide spread of the Coronavirus, China's export was down 11.4% in the first quarter of 2020, and outlook remains uncertain. We have been working closely with local governments in China to direct export-oriented production capacity toward domestic consumption demand. COVID-19 has forced these high-quality manufacturers to focus on domestic market opportunities earlier than they might have otherwise. This plays well into our C2M vision, and we look forward to working with them to offer more value for money products tailored for our users.\n\nOn COVID-19 impact. In the first quarter of 2020, China's GDP fell by 6.8 from a year ago. Total retail sales of consumer goods were down 19%. At the same time, the worldwide pandemic started to weigh on China's exports. Consumers relied on e-commerce for the bulk of their purchases during the crisis.\n\nSince our March end earnings call, travel restrictions for most areas of China have been lifted and the physical outlets have been reopened. The domestic economy has started to recover, we observed that the online retail sales of physical goods increased by 5.9% during the first quarter, the pace of our online buying picked up in March, when logistics networks and the supply chain resumed to full capacity.\n\nFor Pinduoduo, this past quarter was among the most challenging in our brief history, but we continue to solidly execute our user-centric strategy. For the last 12 months ended March 31st, 2020, we recorded GMV growth of 108% to RMB1,157 billion and served 628 million annual active buyers, up 62% from a year ago and 43 million from last quarter. Our first quarter revenue grow 44% to RMB6.5 billion and it will continue to invest in sales and marketing to engage and support our users when they were mostly in need. This past quarter was also one of the most rewarding for us, because we were able to make significant contributions to the society. We also saw the next generation of leaders emerging as they stepped up to serve our users, which I will explain on later.\n\nDuring the peakest outbreak in China, our team tried [Phonetic] to ensure that the daily needs of our users are matching the timely fashion within the safety of of -- of their homes. We then devoted our energies to support the recovery and online migration of many offline business as the impact of COVID-19 subsidize. As a platform serving over 600 million users, COVID-19 reminded us of how important PDD has become to our ecosystem of users, merchants and the business partners.\n\nIn order to help the small and medium sizesd the business owners and our platform, we proactively reduced advertising fees charged to merchants, provided incentives for those fulfilling orders during outbreak and directed free traffic to medical supplies and and household items that our users needed the most while under quarantine.\n\nIn addition, we subsidized medical products such as mask and disinfectant to help counter price spikes, due to the supply demand imbalance. We also defrayed part of the logistics costs. These initiatives resulted in a lower revenue as a percentage of our GMV and a higher cost of goods sold during the first quarter, but it was the right thing to do I believe.\n\nDuring this time period, we remain focused on building trust with our users, trust in the sense of community has become more critical in such uncertain times. For example, we stepped up our commitment in live streaming and made it accessible to all our merchants, another feature we build trust as a community squad shopping feature that we introduced to help lockdown consumers in local communities to buy daily necessities and fruit from nearby groceries and supermarkets.\n\nAs a result, we have observed a positive impact in our user engagement metrics, although the first quarter is typically the slowest for e-commerce, MAU to active annual buyers ratio increased from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2019 to 77.6% in the first quarter in 2020. This ratio reflects improvement in our user satisfaction and as more users are finding products on our platform of their interest, meet their expectations and a prompt them to place orders.\n\nOn our team and internal initiatives, this past quarter, we overcame some of the greatest challenges since our company's inception. As the founder and CEO, I was touched to see our team put serving our 600 million plus user community as their top priority. This commitment reflects the value of our employees, the corporate culture of [Indecipherable] that we seek to build.\n\nAs I said on our March conference call, we saw many young people emerge through this time period as new leaders of our business. They have stepped up, and they -- and their aspiration and innovation are pushing us all forward in our quest to realize Pinduoduo's vision. During COVID-19, these young leaders made practical business decisions and executed them soundly, exceeding the expectations of our substantial user base. This is why, we as a company were able to accelerate the recovery of our business and grow our average daily order volume to over 50 million in March. They are ready to take on more responsibilities for running the business.\n\nThe year had a -- is very important for PDD. Last year, our GMV crossed RMB1 trillion milestone and has kept growing. We're encouraged by this recognition from our users, but at the same time we feel even greater responsibility of our shareholders. We take this responsibility seriously and we continue to reflect on how we can improve, how can we provide our user with a better experience on PDD. How can we make the discovery on our platform more efficient, more engaging and more fun; how can we offer them more choices and give them more reassurance on quality and value.\n\nThis year we will focus on not only growth, but also on the number of key initiatives that would form a sound foundation for our future. These include continuing to improve on corporate governance, upgrading internal systems, improving personnel development and evaluation, streamline internal approval process and motivating more internal idea generation and resource competition.\n\nIn the past two months, we completed our internal performance review and feedback. As mentioned in our March call, most of our employees received a pay raise in recognition of their dedication and contribution. We have also promoted a number of them. We hope to see more of them grow into new leaders of our company. As I mentioned in my letter to shareholders, in this new era, we as a new life form should proceed more humbly and bear more responsibility. This is true for us as a company and for our young people as a new generation of leaders.\n\nLet me now turn over to David to discuss the financial results for the quarter.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Colin, and hello, everyone. Let me first comment on our capital markets activity since the end of the first quarter. First, we subscribed for $200 million of convertible bonds in GOME, a leading retailer home appliances and consumer electronics in China. We entered into a strategic co-operation agreement pursuant to which GOME will migrate all the topline SKUs on to our platform and work together with us to offer more customized branded goods and better offline services. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities that will increase value to our users and to our shareholders.\n\nSecondly, we launched a private placement of $1.1 billion at the end of March after receiving strong reverse inquiries on long-term investors. The placement was closed in early April. Net proceeds from the placement will only be reflected in our financials for the June quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter ended March 31st, 2020 do not include cash raised on this placement. Since the placement the company has received a number of questions on our capital raises, operating cash flow and cash position.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to respond. First, why did we go ahead with the private placement in March? Like any blue chip companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, Disney, Pfizer and Netflix that raised capital in the past few months. We also expect high global economic uncertainty and capital market volatility to persist, as the world economy struggles to regain its foothold. At the same time, we expect the challenging outlook to give raise to more attractive investment opportunities. The March private replacement further strengthens our net cash position to weather a potential economic downturn and to pursue strategic opportunities without having to compromise the flexibility in our core business. GOME is a good example.\n\nSecond question, why have we tapped the capital markets so many times since our IPO? This is a good question. In fact, we had anticipated this possibility at the time of our IPO. As Colin mentioned in his shareholders letter this year, we should be and we are extremely grateful of our precious youth. One feature of being young, however is that we grow very fast. This works sometimes to our advantage, but sometimes to our disadvantage.\n\nWhen we went public in 2018, in order to complete our listing expeditiously and not distract management from growing the business, we specifically limited the size of our offering in terms of dilution to be the smallest among comparable US listed TMT companies by market cap. Dilution at the time of our IPO was 8.2%, as compared to anywhere between 10% to 20% stake offered by other issuers at IPO.\n\nAs a result, we were able to complete our IPO on extremely tight timetable as opposed to at least a year for others. We have sold in aggregate 16.2% of our company on a fully diluted and as converted basis, inclusive of IPO, similar to the normal IPO dilution of other US listed companies. As we operate in a hypercompetitive industry against peers with much more substantial capital resources, we believe continuing to be nimble and optimistic on financing will enable us to optimize our net proceeds, while minimizing dilution.\n\nThird question, is PDD raising money again, because it's burning cash too quickly? Many people have assumed that our increased sales and marketing expenses imply we are burning cash and subsidizing our users with investors' capital. We would like to point out to our investors, analysts and the public to look closer at our cash flow statements. Even though we may from time-to-time the core -- quarter of net operating outflow, because of seasonality such as this past quarter. Our cash flows from operations on an annual basis have been positive since 2016.\n\nEven if we exclude changes in payables to merchant, which our funds held in escrow for merchants. Our annual operating cash flows are still positive. This means that the cash generated from our core business is sufficient to fund our operations without using the cash contributed from our financing and investing activities. In addition, our net working capital is negative and changes in our net working operating capital are also negative, reflecting our efficient net working capital management.\n\nIn summary, our operations have been self-sustaining since the end of 2017. We have not needed to spend any proceeds from our capital raising on our operations, including the coupons and promotion programs. Given we already have sufficient cash flow from operations, some investors may want to probe further on why we fund raise from a capital markets at all. This is also a good question.\n\nColin mentioned in his shareholder letter at the time of our IPO that we are committed to become an open and transparent platform from day one, despite being young and far from perfect. As a platform serving 628 million users in China and potentially more in the future. We believe we could provide the public with more transparency, if we are supervised by our users and the market as a public-listed company, just like this quarterly earnings call. It has indeed helped our team to grow faster as a public company in the past two years.\n\nLet me now shift gears and provide some updates on our C2M and agricultural initiatives. Many of our ecosystem partners suffer from COVID-19 and we have been doing our part to help with their recovery. Starting in March, we hosted a series of live streaming PDD fairs in China's key production centers including Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong in collaboration with local governments and merchants to promote locally produced specialties.\n\nAs of April 30th, total order number originated from these live streaming events reached 49 million. We have field a strategic cooperation agreements with these local governments to continue our support for high quality local manufacturers and merchants, whom we believe can be strong partners for our C2M initiatives over the long term. Merchants selling agricultural products were also negatively impacted during the outbreak.\n\nIn addition to the measures and support that we mentioned in our March earnings call, we announced our plan to invest RMB50 billion over the next five years to build up infrastructure to assist farmers to sell online more efficiently. Agricultural products contributed 13.6% of our 2019 GMV. In the first quarter of 2020, total orders of agricultural products reached 1 billion, representing 184% year-on-year increase and SKUs were with more than 100,000 orders also reached 1,030 about 70% of our 2019 full-year number. Within the next three years, we'll continue to promote these sales result of agriculture products to traffic support, training, live streaming and other features we aim to have more than 1 million agriculture product stores with more than RMB1 million sales in the year.\n\nNow, let me take you through our financial results for the quarter ended March 31st, 2020, We continue to see strong growth in our key operating metrics in the first quarter of 2020. Our annual active buyers for the last 12 months ended March 31st reached 628.1 million, representing an increase of 42.9 million from our 2019 annual active buyers. Compared to the first quarter in 2019, our last 12-month active annual buyer base grew by 42%. Despite the first quarter being an off-season for e-commerce, our average annual active -- our average monthly active users in the quarter increased from a preceding fourth quarter peak season of 487.4 million or 68% growth from a year ago.\n\nDuring the first quarter, China online gross retail sales grew 5.9% year-on-year to reach nearly RMB1.9 trillion. As most people -- more people stay home, they relied on e-commerce, due to social distancing measures. Pinduoduo saw an increase in purchases of medical supplies and household staples during the peak of the COVID-19 and we observed strong recovery in discretionary consumption in March. Our last 12 month GMV grew 108% year-on-year to reach RMB1.1572 trillion. The strong GMV growth reflected a sustained growth in our annual spending per active buyer, which was 47% to reach RMB1,842.4.\n\nWe recognized that our users are increasingly relying on us. Not only is our active buyer base growing, we see them gaining trusting our platform and buying higher value merchandise at higher frequency. We will continue to serve our users by providing them with a consistent and satisfying shopping experience.\n\nOur total revenues in the quarter ended March 31st, 2020 were RMB6.5 billion, up 44% from RMB4.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Our total revenue comprised of online marketing services revenues and transaction services revenue. Online marketing services revenue contributed RMB5.5 billion this quarter, constituting 84% of our total revenue, this was up 39%, compared to the same period last year.\n\nTransaction services revenue was RMB1 billion this quarter, constituting 16% of our total revenue, and up 76%, compared to the same period last year. This quarter is the first time in our history that our online marketing services revenue increased at a lower rate, compared to our transaction services revenue. This was due to a few different factors: one, as Coronavirus broke during Chinese New Year holiday, small and medium-sized merchants were adversely impacted and hence reduced their advertising spend below their typical low season levels.\n\nTwo, we supported our merchants in particular small and medium-sized enterprises by offering them lower effective advertising rates.\n\nAnd three, we also directed traffic that we could have otherwise monetized to dedicated channels for medical supplies, household staples and other necessities in high demand.\n\nSince March, we have seen pickup in advertising activity by our merchants, including SMEs with advertising rates returning to normal levels. Although the initiatives during the first quarter had a negative financial impact, we believe that we are doing the right thing and fulfilling our responsibility as the second largest e-commerce platform in China. We are building invaluable trust with our 628 million users and 5.1 million merchants in this time of crisis.\n\nMoving on to cost. Our cost of revenues increased 110% from RMB873.3 million in the same period last year to RMB1.8 billion this quarter. This translate to a gross margin of 72%. Total cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher cost for cloud services, call centers and merchant support services, particularly as we rolled out our live streaming features to all the merchants.\n\nTotal operating expenses this quarter were RMB9.1 billion, as compared to RMB5.8 billion in the same quarter 2019. Our sales and marketing expenses this quarter increased 49% to RMB7.3 billion from RMB4.9 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was 108%, as compared to 103% for the same quarter last year. The increase of our sales and marketing expenses is mainly to help users weather through the pandemic.\n\nGiven the reduced advertising activities by our merchant during the first quarter, particularly in February, we could have pared back our sales and marketing budget for the quarter and focused on minimizing loss. Instead, our management team made a deliberate decision to further invest in our ecosystem and reallocate our spending in ways that would benefit our users and merchants most in this time of crisis, because we consider this the right approach for our long-term success. When COVID-19 started to spread at the end of January, we acted quickly and stabilized prices of medical supplies, and other critical products via targeted subsidies.\n\nIn addition, to assist merchants selling agriculture products to secure their inventories, we provided support and hosted several promotions to boost their sales on our platform. With the economy in China still recovering and the global situation is still evolving, we will continue to invest in building deeper trust and long-term relationship with our users and seller community.\n\n2020 will continue to be an important year of investments for us. Given we have already surpassed 600 million active buyers, we want to reiterate that it is not the new users whom we are investing our sales and marketing on, but all of our users, particularly the existing ones. This is because the existing users come to trust us more. As they come to trust us more, they will share their experiences with their friends and families and their social contacts, and from time-to-time invite them to purchase together.\n\nTherefore, we continue to invest in their trust mindshare [Phonetic] engagement with us. In the next few quarters, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain fairly dynamic and we will continue to invest when we see opportunities that meet our ROI requirements.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were RMB338.3 million, an increase of 43% from $236.1 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, our G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2%.\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB1.5 billion, an increase of 121% from RMB667.1 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel, and an increase in R&D related cloud services expenses. We plan to further invest in our R&D in 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 17%.\n\nTo sum up, operating loss for the quarter was RMB3.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis, compared with operating loss of RMB1.6 billion in the same quarter of 2019. Operating loss on a GAAP basis was RMB4.4 billion, compared to RMB2.1 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nNet loss attributable to our ordinary shareholders was RMB4.1 billion on a GAAP basis, as compared to net loss of RMB1.9 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per ADS were RMB3.54 on a GAAP basis, compared to RMB1.64 in the same quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB3.2 billion, compared to RMB1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS were RMB2.73, compared to RMB1.2 in the same quarter of 2019. That completes our profit and loss statement for the quarter.\n\nNet cash flow used in operating activities was RMB567.1 million, down from RMB1.5 billion used in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in online marketing services revenues. As of March 31st, 2020, the company had RMB32.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Excluding restricted cash, we had RMB5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had RMB37 billion in short-term investments.\n\nOur short-term investments include time deposits, money market funds and other securities that can be monetized readily. As such, investors in evaluating our cash reserve should consider our short-term investment together with our cash and cash equivalents. As of the end of March, we had RMB42.6 billion of cash reserve excluding net proceeds of $1.1 billion from our recent private placement.\n\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Thank you.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Natalie Wu of CICC. Please ask your question.\n\nNatalie Wu -- CICC -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very robust quarter. So just wondering what do you think that plays as the major driver behind your GMV growth reacceleration in the first quarter, in spite of the COVID-19 impact? And also, in terms of the live streaming function, how does that help your GMV growth on a platform for -- in terms of the SSSG according to your observation? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Natalie, for the question. In terms of GMV growth, we see that as a reflection of our users continued endorsement of our strategy and our platform. And so you have demonstrated through the first quarter we continued to make sales and marketing investments in our users and in our merchants. And as China recover or as the pandemic subsided toward the end of February and heading into March, we have seen strong recovery in consumer demand.\n\nSo overall, I would say that the consumer demand has not been impacted in COVID-19. And you saw a lot of catch-up as a result of both merchants promoting, increasing the promotion activities on our platform, as well as logistics being back in normal levels. So this is why we believe we were able to -- by middle of March start shipping over 50 million daily orders on a daily basis. And because of that, we see that the consumers spending on our platform are now with higher frequency and also with higher ARPU, resulting in overall increase in our LTM GMV.\n\nIn terms of live streaming, specifically, as you have mentioned, this is a new business initiative for us. We only rolled our live streaming to all the merchants in January despite the product being online at the end of last year. We see live streaming as a great way to bring online and offline -- we see live streaming as a great way to bring online, these offline experiences our US users may not be privy to in their daily lives. So through live streamings we are encouraging merchants to bring platform users into their day-to-day to share with them interesting [Indecipherable] parts about their products. As such, we believe that you have the benefit of lowering barrier -- so lowering consumers aversion to spend in certain categories such as jewelry or live seafood that we are selling on the platform. And we believe that this will -- this is beneficial in creating further engagement and stickiness and repeat the purchases between merchants and users.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eddy Wang of Morgan Stanley. Please ask question.\n\nEddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is also about the GMV and the ARPU growth in the first quarter. You mentioned that in March actually you have witnessed your users have increased the discretionary items. Can you elaborate more about what, kind of, the discretionary items you have witnessed user spending in March? And what are the key items categories you would like to expand actually this year for the platform? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Eddy. In terms of our GMV distribution by product categories, I would say that the COVID -19 impact is -- that's temporary. So overall for the quarter we have now observed our GMV distribution to deviate significantly from where it was before. So apparels and FMCG continue to account for the most of our GMV for the quarter. We have seen apparels during the height of the pandemic to be more impacted relative to other categories. But in general, we have seen pickup in activities across the board.\n\nSpecific to our platform, we continue to evaluate our consumers' interest and needs and we continue to expand our strategy of being -- deepening the best offerings in the categories, as far as increasing our breadth. Specifically, I think, you know, as we have demonstrated through much of 2019, our investments in building trust with our users are paying off in categories such as cosmetics, consumer electronics and these will be categories that we continue to grow, heading into 2020, but we are seeing growth across the board.\n\nEddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Thomas Chong of Jefferies. Please ask your question.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nGood evening. Thanks management for taking my questions. I'm asking on behalf of Thomas Chong. And my question is about the GMV strategies. We can see that this time the GMV is showing a very good result and do we have any strategies in driving the GMV and user growth in 2020 and especially in second half? And we also want to ask about any update on the C2M initiative? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nSure. In terms of our GMV growth driver, as we have mentioned, the focus for the platform or strategy is really revolves around user engagement. And it is about giving the users what they want and serving them well. So we do see the strong growth in the first quarter in our GMV, despite the low seasonality and the challenges posed by the epidemic, as an endorsement by user of our efforts paying off, meaning that we are seeing users being able to shop with more confidence on our platform and buying things with greater assurance and we intend to continue to invest in our user engagements.\n\nAs I mentioned in my own remarks, our social marketing spend are really targeted at all the users on our platform, particularly the existing ones, because these are users who are familiar and recognize the value that we bring to their consumption and these are influences, to put differently, for our platform that will be able to continue to help spread the experiences that PDD to others and help us bringing other users and making them also more engaged on our platform.\n\nIn terms of C2M, I would note that the C2M is a long-term secular trend and it is not a winner-takes-all game. So this is something that will take considerably more time and effort to drive. And in 2019, we have 106 full-fledged C2M partners and we believe we're on track to hit a 1,000 of these partners by year-end of 2020.\n\nThe current -- coming out of COVID-19, as Colin had mentioned, we believe that we are even better -- more better positioned to take benefit, because COVID-19 has forced a lot of export-oriented manufacturers and merchants to rethink a lot harder about their strategy and refocus on the domestic consumption. So by working with the local governance and manufacturers, we have been able to identify a lot of strong potential partners that we believe will accelerate our C2M efforts over the long-term.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Han Joon Kim of Macquarie. Please ask your question. Excuse me, Mr. Han Joon Kim, your line is open.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOperator, why don't we move on to the question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joyce Ju of Bank of America. Please ask your question.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGood evening, management. Congratulations on a solid result and thanks for taking my question. My question is actually related to the commission revenues we report this quarter. We actually understand this quarter, the advertising revenue actually grow slower than commission revenue, the course of like we actually provide them free traffic through the merchants and also they actually have lower advertising budgets.\n\nBut just curious like per the calculation, like the transaction revenue, it seems like the commission rate this quarter actually is higher than the second half of last year. So just to make sure, do we actually include some of the other like membership revenue or like -- or other transaction related revenue to this revenue line or it's just the core, because we have higher payment or other transaction-related costs. So we have to also increase the charge on the merchants for this particular revenue as well? Thanks.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nJoyce, thanks a lot for the question. So to answer your question, our definition for transaction services revenue is consistent through quarters. So it is the same as what we have -- is on the same basis that we have disclosed in the prior quarter. I would say that we do see increased costs in our business and this is partly reflected in the gross margins, because we are investing a lot more aggressively in cloud infrastructures in order to support live streaming on our platform.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nBut on the commission rate side, we are not really adding charts [Phonetic] for payment or as a charge to merchants right?\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nNo.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap of Citigroup. Please ask your question.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good evening, management. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the level of the support that you provide to merchants. So any qualitative color that you could give us in terms of the magnitude in which way and for how long? is that in the form of more the free traffic support or is it more the payment commission rebates? And then on the matching, or is it the matching for the promotion pricing now to the sales and marketing? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Alicia. As we -- as I have mentioned in my remark, we do believe that, well, I think, well, a couple of things, I suppose. First, the COVID-19 does mean that our many of our merchants have to cut back their sales and marketing, their own advertising budget in the first quarter and certainly in much of the February this was impacted.\n\nIn response to the difficulties that our merchants are making, we do -- we are offering better incentive programs. This takes both in the form of effectively lower rates, as well as free traffic as you have mentioned. So in terms of trying to exterminate the impact, I will encourage, Alicia, you to take a look at our take rate so to speak for online advertising revenue in other quarters, and estimate how we have the -- I guess, the GMV that we were generating for this quarter, if we were receiving the same type of take rate what that content would be. And I think you will notice that our profitability will be significantly improved.\n\nAnd you're right, in fact, because of the support that we have given to the merchants, I would just add on top of that, we have seen the activities on advertising pickup in March, as well as through the rates returning to more normalized level.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the solid results.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charlie Chen of China Renaissance. Please ask your question.\n\nCharlie Chen -- China Renaissance Securities -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a follow-up question on the take rate, which I have elaborated a little bit more. So just to go back to the question, so you are thinking basically the GMV growth basically is robust and you give free traffic as centric to subsidize merchants during this difficult situation. So do you think there is a need for you to continue to subsidize them in this recovery periods in the coming quarter and going forward? And if you don't need to give so much subsidies as you did before, do you think that will be negatively impact your GMV going forward? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nSo, as I have mentioned earlier, our take rate so to speak or the revenue that we are generating from our online marketing services since March, we have seen that returning to very much normalized level and heading into April and May. We -- and secondly, as I mentioned that by middle of March we were shipping already 50 million parcels on a daily basis. So both the business momentum, I would say for our platform has recovered to fairly normalized level, and also in terms of revenue generation, we believe, we are very close to -- if not ahead of where we were ahead of COVID-19.\n\nCharlie Chen -- China Renaissance Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.\n\nPiyush Mubayi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my call. My question is quite simple in that. If you look at what's happened in the quarter with COVID-19, yet your GMV grew astonishing 99%. I wonder, if you could comment on what the -- what could have happened to your GMV had COVID-19 not happened? And can we use that as a run rate for what could happen for the rest of the year, i.e., are we into an accelerated mode of GMV growth post COVID-19? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThanks, Piyush, for the question. I do believe the investment that we have made in our ecosystem, our partners and our users through this period is positive to our overall business momentum and emerging from the COVID-19 and let's just say take early March as a starting point, we do see a stronger business momentum in terms of -- both in terms of user behavior, but also more importantly merchants trying to catch up for a -- the lot of the time that they have lost in the first quarter. So we are certainly seeing more willingness of merchants to spend and engage with users. And that should help to some extent the consumptions. But more importantly, from our perspective, we do think that the users on our platform are now shopping with higher frequency and are making purchases of higher ARPU number -- items.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, let me add a few words. So for the first quarter, the pandemic definitely has a negative impact on the business even for the GMV, because the deliver capacity during that period of time is shrink [Phonetic] significantly. Then in China now, all the businesses, sort of, reopened, the society is getting back to normal. So I would say that -- well the growth rate and everything should -- is sort of back to the normal stage. But how big the impact either negative or positive, the pandemic will have on our business. In the short-term, I would say it won't be that significant, let's look at next quarter or the quarter after next.\n\nBut if you look at this problem, I'm trying to answer this problem in a two-year or three-year time frame, I would say it will be very interesting and I would say the impact will be huge either negative or positive, because I believe some of the user behaviors both online and offline will be changed significantly. And many parts of the supply chain is being shaped and/or being shaped or changed in a very fundamental way. And it will not be back to the date -- to the normal stage. It will be a new normal. Whether the new normal is a good or bad, it's hard to say, but it's going to be a new format, it's a new ecosystem. Right now, I think we're, sort of, in a fairly good position to prosper in the next page. Yes, thank you.\n\nPiyush Mubayi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, let's move to next -- at this time we have -- the next question will be the last question for this call.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Binnie Wong of HSBC. Please ask your question.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you, management, for taking the question, and congrats again for a very solid quarter here. I have a question here is that if I look at the -- like the number this quarter in terms of the revenue versus GMV, the quarterly monetization rate boosted a fit to fit. Just a function because of our fast growing GMV or is it because of something else that we are -- because it's the pandemic quarter, we want to support our merchants better? Or is there something else that we should be aware off?\n\nAnd then following up on this question, I think, you spoke about it last quarter, talking about if you look at the mix in terms of how we lift up the ARPU, right? Because, of course, user base were catching up with our peers, but then ARPU is still of a gap, right? How are we going to raise our ARPU this year? Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Binnie. So, I think your first question was regarding the take rate in general. So during the first quarter, we have seen merchants ability to advertise being impacted by COVID-19, so that's one aspect of it. And because of it and in order to continue support them, we also gave them better effective rates, advertising rates for the first quarter. So that had a direct impact on our online marketing services take rate for the first quarter. I mean, as I mentioned, we have seen the activities pick-up in March and the rates are returning to normal level.\n\nSecond question around the mix and how do we go about increasing the ARPU? I think, the key for us is actually to continue to invest in our existing users to make sure that they continue find products that they find interesting and gain growing confidence to be able to shop more frequently and make this really the primary e-commerce destination. So it's about investing in people's mindshare, it's about investing in the engagement and we have seen result in the pickup in the activities and also in ARPU in the first quarter. And we believe that we are on the right trend. So as the frequency increases and as we bring more selection available to our users, we believe the ARPUs will naturally catch up.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. So let me -- regarding ARPU, let me simply put this way. Raising ARPU is not a part of our management team's KPI. But I think it will be a natural result as users engagement increases over time.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Thank you.

While it posted a better-than-expected 22% rise in March quarter revenue of 114.3 billion yuan, that marked its slowest pace of expansion on record. Alibaba\u2019s shares slid more than 5% in New York.\n\nOnline shopping began to bounce back from March, executives said Friday. But the tepid outlook demonstrates the world\u2019s second largest economy has yet to fully shake off Covid-19, with consumers still hesitant about spending on big-ticket items. Asia\u2019s largest corporation is tackling also the rise of rivals such as ByteDance Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc. And the Tmall operator is going head-to-head with Tencent Holdings Ltd. for internet leadership in everything from online media to payments and cloud computing.\n\nAlibaba has lost more than $40 billion of market value since the coronavirus first erupted in January, and now has to grapple with not just an uncertain global economic environment but also any potential fallout from U.S.-Chinese financial tensions. On Friday, executives sought to assuage concerns about a U.S. bill that mandates much closer accounting scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese companies and may bar them from American bourses.\n\nChief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said Alibaba\u2019s financial statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting measures and were beyond reproach. \u201cThe integrity of Alibaba\u2019s financial statements speak for itself, we have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the highest standard,\u201d she told analysts on a conference call. \u201cWe will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges.\u201d\n\nThe bigger short-term challenge is in reviving growth: Alibaba\u2019s bread-and-butter customer management or marketing business grew just 3% in the March quarter. Much of that stems from weaker consumer sentiment during the coronavirus-stricken quarter, when total Chinese e-commerce rose just 5.9% or at less than a third of 2019\u2019s pace, according to government data.\n\nRival PDD posted a revenue rise of 44% on Friday, down sharply from 91% in the previous quarter, although that still beat expectations. Its sales and marketing expenses jumped 49%.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s net income was 3.2 billion yuan, down 88% from a year ago when it booked an 18.7 billion yuan one-time gain on investments. In February, Alibaba declared a waiver of some service fees for merchants struggling financially during the outbreak on its main direct-to-consumer Tmall platform. In April, the company rolled out a new 10-billion-yuan subsidy program for Tmall users to buy electronics, encroaching on JD.com Inc.\u2019s traditional turf. These initiatives may further compress margins for the June quarter.\n\n\u201cThe challenging part is for them to achieve the same amount of growth this year,\u201d said Steven Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst with Pacific Epoch. \u201cJust because they are too big, for the same amount of growth, they need to spend much more effort.\u201d\n\nBut executives were confident in a gradual e-commerce recovery over the year. Beyond its main business, younger divisions such as its cloud computing arm should buoy its bottom line. That division\u2019s revenue jumped 58% in the quarter.\n\n\u201cDespite a challenging quarter due to reduced economic activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, we achieved our annual revenue guidance,\u201d Wu said in a statement. \u201cAlthough the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen a steady recovery since March.\u201d\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe company\u2019s businesses most impacted by merchant and logistic disruptions are also its most lucrative, such as retail marketplaces Taobao and Tmall, while faster-growing segments like cloud computing and digital entertainment don\u2019t contribute to profit. Subsidies for users and merchants will add to costs. Alibaba may provide an improved growth outlook for the June quarter given the retreat of the pandemic in China, but the recovery could be gradual as consumption sentiment remains weak.\n\n- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."}, "News 6": {"title": "Pinduoduo beats revenue estimates as online shopping demand soars", "keywords": ["pinduoduo", "beats", "company", "million", "quarter", "revenue", "shopping", "online", "estimates", "reported", "demand", "yuan", "soars", "billion"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinduoduo-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-103905207.html", "summary": "Stay-at-home orders have boosted demand for online shopping as people stock up on groceries and food items from home and sellers too turn to online platforms to run down inventories.\nIts net loss widened to 4.12 billion yuan in the quarter ended March 31, from 1.88 billion yuan a year earlier.\nThe e-commerce company known for its deep discounts, said revenue rose 44% to 6.54 billion yuan ($916.63 million), beating estimates of 4.97 billion yuan, according to IBES data by Refinitiv.\nHowever, quarterly revenue dropped sharply from 10.79 billion yuan it reported for the fourth quarter last year.\nExcluding items, the company lost 2.73 yuan per American depository share compared with estimates of loss of 1.97 yuan per ADS.", "text": "FILE PHOTO: A display at the Nasdaq Market Site shows a message after Chinese online group discounter Pinduoduo Inc.

Shares of the three companies were up 10.3%, 8%, and 4.8% respectively as of 12:40 p.m. EDT.\n\nSo what\n\nCruise line stocks have generally been moving higher this week on optimism that the economy is going to get better and, by extension, cruises will resume operation sometime in 2020. Companies are starting to take reservations for August and laying out plans to launch ships in a phased manner. On top of the operational optimism, all three of these companies have raised funds that should allow them to remain solvent for multiple quarters, if not years, without customers. That's the long-term picture, but it's not what's driving shares today.\n\nWhat got investors excited in the short term was Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken initiating coverage on the industry with a relatively bullish outlook. He initiated Norwegian Cruise Line with an outperform rating and a $21 price target, Royal Caribbean with an outperform rating and a $67 price target, and Carnival with a $12 price target and a neutral rating. Given the price targets, it's understandable why Chaiken is more bullish on Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean, with their current prices around $14 and $44 per share, respectively.\n\nNow what\n\nThe short-term driver of cruise line shares isn't something I would put much energy into as an investor. Analyst upgrades or downgrades can move stocks in the short term, but long-term business fundamentals and consumer spending are what will drive a recovery in the cruise line business.\n\nWhat investors should be cautious about is the early customers eager to cruise again in late summer or fall being followed by a very skeptical market in 2021. Travel is likely to be down across the globe for the foreseeable future and while there are cruise diehards, it's the marginal customer that's going to drive profitability for the growing fleet of cruise liners in operation. It's this long-term risk that will keep me from investing in cruise line stocks today. I simply don't think the business will return to what it was in the next few years, and we may be in for years of disappointing earnings and cash flows as a result."}, "News 2": {"title": "This Analyst Sees Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean as Good Bets", "keywords": ["carnival", "lines", "cruise", "norwegian", "chaiken", "attractive", "sees", "bets", "caribbean", "line", "doesnt", "royal", "good", "industry", "analyst"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/21/this-analyst-sees-carnival-norwegian-cruise-line-a.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "The cruise ship industry has been tempest-tost as the COVID-19 pandemic shipwrecked the stocks of Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) over the last three months with losses of 60% or more.\nYet Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken thinks now is the right time to embark on an adventure with these companies.\nNot all cruise ships are equalChaiken initiated coverage on Carnival, Norwegian, and Royal, though he sees the latter two cruise lines as better investments.\nHe wrote in a note to investors that people will begin taking vacations eventually and the value proposition of the cruise industry will drive the business higher, according to TheFly.com.\nHowever, despite Carnival's seemingly attractive valuation, he doesn't see it outperforming Norwegian Cruise Lines or Royal Caribbean, and has rated it neutral in his new coverage.", "text": "The cruise ship industry has been tempest-tost as the COVID-19 pandemic shipwrecked the stocks of Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) over the last three months with losses of 60% or more.\n\nYet Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken thinks now is the right time to embark on an adventure with these companies.

Each company has raised billions apiece in recent months, but some Wall Street pros wonder if the major players have enough money to stay afloat.\n\nAhead of Wednesday morning's earnings report from Royal Caribbean, Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Conder put out an updated note in which liquidity was front and center. Even after completing a senior secured notes offering, Conder figures that the country's second-largest cruise line would have to raise another $2.5 billion to $3 billion to weather the worst-case no-sail scenario, which pushes the disruption well into next year. Royal Caribbean went on to report expectedly crummy financial results, but with roughly $3.3 billion in current liquidity and a monthly cash burn rate of $250 million to $275 million during a prolonged suspension of operations, does it really have to raise money right now? With its stock price trading 70% below its January highs, this may not be the best time to secure financing through what may include issuing new stock or convertible debt.\n\nCash floats\n\nCruise lines continue to expect to resume some form of travel this summer. Carnival has firm plans to sail a few of its ships from three ports in Florida and Texas starting in August. Yesterday we saw Royal Caribbean and Norwegian also cancel all trips through the end of July, even though Royal Caribbean feels that it may be able to get its Chinese cruises going as early as July.\n\nWorking the math on Royal Caribbean's current liquidity and its cash burn rate would seem to have it stashing away more than enough dry powder to get it into next year if sailings keep getting canceled. Carnival and Norwegian have also been fortifying their liquidity since the industry interruption, increasing their chances of solvency for what could be a pronounced downtime.\n\nA couple of analysts lowered their price targets on Royal Caribbean following Wednesday's quarterly report, and one of them -- Brandt Montour at JPMorgan -- singled out the cruise line's \"shorter liquidity runway\" relative to Carnival and Norwegian. Why is Wall Street so worked up over a company with more than $3 billion in liquidity?\n\nWell, as we've already seen, no one knows when cruise ships will begin taking on passengers again. Every few weeks we find Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian pushing out their resumption dates by a few weeks. The longer this game goes on, the more frustrated booked passengers will become. Right now fewer than half of the customers on canceled sailings are requesting cash refunds over enhanced credit on future sailings. If we're in the fall or winter and the industry players are still kicking this can down the road, will folks still be comfortable locking up their money with cruise lines?\n\nIt also goes without saying that the cash burn doesn't end the moment paying customers start sailing again. The industry itself won't be profitable for some time, and there is going to be a costly marketing tab to restore consumer sentiment when it comes to cruising. There may also be some hefty legal tabs to pay. The uncertainties remain, and that's before considering the inevitable global recession that will limit what those who want to sail can pay. There's a reason the stocks continue to be depressed, but until we get a clearer picture of how bleak things are, near-term liquidity isn't the biggest problem for the industry right now."}, "News 4": {"title": "Is Royal Caribbean Stock Really Headed to $63?", "keywords": ["stock", "carnival", "cruise", "revenue", "headed", "trends", "norwegian", "caribbean", "share", "royal", "ship", "63", "really"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/21/is-royal-caribbean-stock-really-headed-to-63.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "If you believe one Wall Street pro, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) is the most attractive stock in the battered cruise ship sector.\nRoyal Caribbean did prove the strongest cruise ship business in the quarters preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd those gains came despite a few significant challenges, including the worst hurricane season Royal Caribbean had endured.\nUnder normal circumstances that performance gap would make Royal Caribbean a clear favorite for investors going forward.\nInvestors who believe the cruise industry will sail through those issues might consider buying Royal Caribbean stock.", "text": "If you believe one Wall Street pro, Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) is the most attractive stock in the battered cruise ship sector.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread travel restrictions have caused sailings to be suspended, sending shares to record lows. To survive, cruise operators have gone into cash preservation mode, entering into liquidity enhancing credit agreements.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are hardly lining up to pull the trigger on names within this area of the market. However, five-star analyst Benjamin Chaiken, of Credit Suisse, has a more optimistic view of the industry. He acknowledges that \u201cCOVID -19 may be the toughest challenge the industry has ever faced\u201d, with it potentially taking several years to regain pricing parity. That being said, he argues the \u201cunmatched value proposition of the product\u201d will power a rebound, and that the recent weakness presents an attractive entry point with liquidity struggles already built in.\n\nHighlighting the resiliency of the industry, Chaiken said, \"The cruise industry has bounced back before from deadly accidents, sudden regulatory changes and storms.\u201d He added, \u201cAdditionally, we think the cruise demographic is favorable for a recovery in demand, and could be why 55% of cruise customers, according to our checks, are opting for a cruise credit vs. cash, post COVID -19 disruption. We think this is a very powerful data point highlighting the resiliency in the product, and speaks volumes in terms of future demand for the industry, especially in the context of current sentiment which questions if the product will even exist in the future.\u201d\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, Chaiken points to two cruise line stocks with especially strong long-term growth narratives, initiating coverage of each with bullish ratings. The analyst does remind clients that not all cruise industry players are set to outperform, recommending that investors avoid one in particular.\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Chaiken\u2019s calls. Here\u2019s what we found out.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL)\n\nWith 63 ships carrying approximately 6 million passengers every year, Royal Caribbean counts itself as one of the top cruise ship operators. While COVID-19 has certainly taken a toll on the company, Chaiken believes that when demand recovers, RCL will be a major beneficiary.\n\nThe Credit Suisse analyst argues that part of the company\u2019s strength is derived from the location in which it operates cruises. \u201cWe think the Caribbean \u2013where RCL is best positioned in terms of capacity allocation and product--could be a bright spot when demand does return. Many Caribbean itineraries require little or no air travel to embarkation, which we think is likely a positive for those with remaining fear over air travel,\u201d he explained. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that \u201cRCL has the ability to market to guests with a shorter booking window.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Chaiken implores investors to take RCL\u2019s performance before the onset of the public health crisis into account. \"We think RCL was gaining significant momentum heading into the Coronavirus-led slowdown, with its CocoCay destination (a private island in the Bahamas offering differentiated land-based activities), demanding price premiums and an had been planning an 80% increase in volume in 2020 vs. 2019, prior to the outbreak,\u201d the analyst stated. He added, \u201cRCL finished 2019 at 108% occupancy and reported net yields of 8%.\u201d\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Chaiken expects several potential tailwinds to emerge post-COVID-19. Its acquisition of Silversea added two ships to the fleet and expanded its agent network, providing a tailwind to yields. Cost tailwinds could also be in RCL\u2019s future.\n\nEven though liquidity and cash burn are considered by some to be a cause for concern, Chaiken is optimistic. \u201cRCL recently raised $3.3 billion in secured notes, giving us further confidence that they should be able to manage the slowdown,\u201d he noted.\n\nTo this end, Chaiken kicked off his RCL coverage by publishing an Outperform rating. Accompanying the bullish call is a $67 price target, which suggests 55% upside potential. (To watch Chaiken\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nLooking at the consensus breakdown, the bulls have it. RCL\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. At $60.36, the average price target implies 39% upside potential.

Reporting from the Washington Post and the Miami Herald shows as many as 65 people may have died after being exposed to the coronavirus onboard cruise ships.\n\nIn late March, the CDC recommended deferring all cruise travel during the pandemic.\n\nEarlier this month, however, cruise operators indicated that by the end of the summer they expect to have ships embarking on cruises and executives from multiple cruise companies have indicated positive booking trends.\n\nAnd analysts at Credit Suisse led by Benjamin Chaiken think now is the time to Buy.\n\nIn a note to clients published Thursday, Chaiken initiated coverage of the three major cruise operators \u2014 Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival Cruises (CCL) \u2014 putting an Outperform rating on Royal and Norwegian and a Neutral rating on Carnival. Credit Suisse put a $67 price target on Royal shares, a $21 price target on Norwegian stock, and a $12 target on shares of Carnival.\n\nShares of Royal and Norwegian rose more than 8% on Thursday following the news; Carnival shares rose over 3%. All three stocks are still down more than 65% this year.\n\nIn Chaiken\u2019s view, the case for these stocks comes down to two big factors \u2014 financial health and consumer demand.\n\n\u201c[Cruise stocks] are at all-time lows, and all three operators are now in cash preservation mode, having entered into liquidity enhancing credit agreements,\u201d Chaiken writes. \u201cWith the risk of a liquidity crunch partially priced in, we think current levels offer an attractive entry point. We believe CCL has 9 months of liquidity (good through the end of November), NCLH ~27 months, and RCL ~12+ months.\u201d\n\nIn other words, none of these companies are at imminent risk of running out of cash after the initial phase of this pandemic appeared to pose an existential threat to the business. Surviving the next few months, however, does not make for a great thesis on its own.\n\nFor that, Chaiken digs into what cruises actually offer consumers: affordable vacations.\n\n\u201cWhile COVID-19 will likely have a lasting impact on the cruise industry, which will potentially take years to regain pricing parity, we think the unmatched value proposition of the product will be a driving force behind a recovery,\u201d Chaiken writes.\n\n\u201cA cruise includes accommodations, activities, meals, and often drinks, at a 50-70% discount to many other types of vacations. We are unable to think of a vacation alternative that involves international travel, multiple locations, entertainment (from live shows to shore excursions), and resort-like amenities at this price point. We believe this is a primary reason cruise demand has rebounded after past slowdowns, with demand returning in ~8-10 months per our estimates.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse's work suggests cruises offer consumers a significant discount to land-based alternatives. (Source: Credit Suisse) More\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s rough math suggests a Caribbean cruise from New Yotk offers a tropical vacation at about 1/3 the cost of flying to the Bahamas. And, yes, of course these trips aren\u2019t exactly equivalent and a few-hours-long pit stop on an island doesn\u2019t replace the experience of walking a few steps to the beach.\n\nBut a $700 vacation is accessible to a far larger number of consumers than a $2,000-plus vacation. And when consumer concerns about safety are addressed and pandemic fears subside, that value isn\u2019t going to go away, in Credit Suisse\u2019s view."}, "no_of_news": 7}, "ICPT": {"company_name": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "News 1": {"title": "ICPT Stock Dives On Unexpected Delay For NASH Treatment", "keywords": ["stock", "nash", "delay", "oca", "market", "dives", "data", "obeticholic", "unexpected", "fda", "treatment", "icpt", "liver"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://www.investors.com/news/technology/icpt-stock-dives-unexpected-delay-nash-treatment/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "An unexpected delay for Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) liver-disease treatment led ICPT stock to crumble on Friday.\nChardan analyst Michael Morabito expects a short-term impact on ICPT stock.\nHe has a buy rating on ICPT stock.\nICPT Stock Dives On DelayNonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a potentially huge market for Intercept and any drugmaker that can successfully treat it.\nOn the stock market today, ICPT stock tumbled 12.2% to 80.51.", "text": "An unexpected delay for Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) liver-disease treatment led ICPT stock to crumble on Friday.\n\nX\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration was tentatively set to discuss the benefits and risks of Intercept's obeticholic acid in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis on June 9.

Following the March 2009 stock market bottom, all three major U.S. indexes ended up at least quadrupling in value, if not delivering even more robust returns. Then the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic came along and disrupted the economy, labor force, and stock market like nothing we'd ever seen before.\n\nUncertainties tied to the coronavirus pushed the broad-based S&P 500 into bear market territory in just 17 trading sessions, marking the fastest decline into a bear market in history. Ultimately, the benchmark index fell 34% in a mere 33 calendar days before rebounding to where it is today.\n\nA bear market is the perfect opportunity for investors to load up on high-quality ETFs\n\nStock market corrections of all sizes have historically proved to be excellent buying opportunities for long-term investors. Although we'll never know ahead of time when a correction will occur, how steep the decline will be, or how long it'll take to hit the bottom, we do have plenty of data showing that the S&P 500 eventually puts all corrections (and bear markets) into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe real decision shouldn't be if you should buy equities, but what you should buy.\n\nI can rightly imagine that some folks wouldn't feel comfortable picking individual stocks, especially given either the volatility we've seen of late or perhaps their own lack of investing knowledge. That's where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come into play. An ETF is a single security that contains a basket of stocks with a specific focus -- based on market cap, growth/value, industry, or some other broad theme. The point is that investors buying into an ETF can gain instant diversification or focus without having to research a dozen or more companies within an industry.\n\nWhat's more, you don't have to have Warren Buffett's wallet to buy into ETFs. If, say, you even have $1,000 in disposable income that won't be used for bills or your emergency fund, you've got more than enough to go shopping for ETFs.\n\nIf you're looking to put your money to work with equities on sale, here are three of the smartest ETFs you can consider buying and holding for at least the next five years.\n\nGlobal X Cloud Computing ETF\n\nThough debatable, one of the more unstoppable industries in the years (or decades) to come will be cloud computing. As businesses continue to move beyond their static office spaces and toward an environment where data can be accessed anywhere by employees, the need for software-, platform-, and infrastructure-as-a-service is only going to grow. That's why the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:CLOU) should be on your buy list.\n\nAs you might imagine, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF is going to give investors an opportunity to be on the cutting edge of cloud technology innovation, all without having to be an expert on the various layers of cloud services. It currently holds 36 different stocks, only two of which have a weighting of more than 5%. This means you're getting a pretty even keel of opportunity, with everything from established infrastructure plays like Amazon to software-as-a-service kingpin Shopify in the mix.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a value ETF. You're buying it to take advantage of the aggressive growth in cloud services that'll likely be accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. That means you'll need to put up with a high trailing price-to-earnings ratio, as well as net expense ratio of 0.68%, which isn't exactly low. But the payoff could be immense if cloud computing continues to grow by a hearty double-digit percentage for the foreseeable future.\n\nVanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF\n\nIn the investment world, \"this time it'll be different\" is often a dangerous phrase. But when it comes to precious-metal mining companies, this time it may very well be different, which is why the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) is worth buying.\n\nGenerally speaking, physical gold and gold miners perform their best toward the tail-end of a recession and early on during a recovery. In other words, we're nearing the sweet spot for precious-metal miners. However, gold-mining stocks tend to underperform the broader market when the economy is firing on all cylinders, leaving them as long-term laggards. But this time could be different.\n\nIn my 21 years of investing, I've never seen a more perfect setup for the gold market. Global bond yields remain historically low, providing few avenues for investors to lock in guaranteed gains. Even if conservative investors find a positive-yielding bond, chances are that it won't outpace the inflation rate, thereby leading to real-money losses. Tack on unlimited quantitative easing in the U.S. and ongoing uncertainty tied to COVID-19, and you have a recipe that makes gold the logical store of value for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, since physical gold offers no yield, the smartest way to play this rise in value is by purchasing gold miners, or more specifically, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF. I suspect we're in a scenario where we could see gold prices comfortably advance for the next five years. That would be great for mining companies that are able to leverage an increase in the physical price of gold.\n\nALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF\n\nAnother ETF that the smartest investors will be buying and holding is the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (NYSEMKT:SBIO).\n\nWhile there are a number of diversified pharmaceutical and biotech ETFs that investors can buy, this one is unique. It holds around six dozen U.S.-based drug developers that typically range in market cap between $200 million and $5 billion and have at least one experimental drug in phase 2 or phase 3 trials. The ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF also screens for sustainability -- drug developers aren't added unless they have enough cash to fund their operations for at least two years.\n\nThe interesting thing here is that most clinical trials are doomed to fail. That's why placing a bet on any one clinical-stage biotech or pharmaceutical company can be risky. But when you own a basket of nearly six dozen under one security, all it takes is a few big wins for the ETF to deliver substantive returns.\n\nFor example, top-15 holding Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) has a date set with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on June 9 regarding Ocaliva as a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In late-stage trials, Intercept's lead drug met one of two co-primary endpoints -- a statistically significant improvement in fibrosis of at least one stage without NASH worsening -- but also led to high instances of pruritus in patients. With no therapies currently approved to treat NASH, Intercept's Ocaliva has an opportunity to achieve first-mover status in a $35 billion indication.\n\nJust a few key wins is all it would take for the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF to shine."}, "News 5": {"title": "Intercept Provides Regulatory Update", "keywords": ["including", "provides", "nash", "pbc", "regulatory", "product", "oca", "intercept", "ability", "fibrosis", "candidates", "update", "liver"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intercept-provides-regulatory-120010620.html", "summary": "The FDA has indicated that it will reach out to Intercept in the near future with a new proposed AdCom date.\nIntercept now anticipates that the FDA\u2019s review of its NDA will extend beyond the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 26, 2020.\nOCA has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis.\nIn the United States, NASH is currently the second leading cause for liver transplantation overall, and in females, the leading cause.\nFounded in 2002 in New York, Intercept has operations in the United States, Europe and Canada.", "text": "NEW YORK, May 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The FDA has indicated that it will reach out to Intercept in the near future with a new proposed AdCom date. Intercept now anticipates that the FDA\u2019s review of its NDA will extend beyond the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 26, 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile this delay was unanticipated, following our most recent dialogue with the FDA we believe that the additional data being submitted will be important in facilitating a more informed discussion at the AdCom,\u201d said Mark Pruzanski, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Intercept. \u201cWe remain confident in our NDA submission and look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to bring the first treatment to patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH.\u201d\n\nIntercept previously announced the FDA\u2019s acceptance of the NDA and granting of priority review. OCA has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis.\n\nAbout Liver Fibrosis due to NASH\n\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious progressive liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver that induces chronic inflammation, resulting in progressive fibrosis (scarring) that can lead to cirrhosis, eventual liver failure, cancer and death. Advanced fibrosis is associated with a substantially higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality in patients with NASH. In the United States, NASH is currently the second leading cause for liver transplantation overall, and in females, the leading cause. NASH is anticipated to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in Europe within the next decade. There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH.\n\nAbout Intercept\n\nIntercept is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Founded in 2002 in New York, Intercept has operations in the United States, Europe and Canada.

And you've got a problem with that, take it up with your senator.\n\nThere was no news today affecting 51job specifically. The last time the company reported earnings was some two months ago, and the company's next earnings report isn't due out for another month. No analysts downgraded 51job stock today, nor did anyone cut price targets on the stock.\n\nNo, it appears that the only reason 51job stock tumbled was that on Wednesday, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that could force Chinese stocks such as 51job to delist from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nSo what\n\nTechnically, of course, that's not what the bill says it aims to do. On the surface, all the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires is that foreign-owned companies -- not even Chinese companies in particular, necessarily -- be able to prove that they are neither owned nor controlled by a foreign government, and submit their financials for review by an American audit firm overseen by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nProblem is, Chinese law doesn't permit that second requirement to happen, and unless China changes its laws, this new U.S. law, once passed, appears likely to result in the delisting of Chinese stocks like 51job.\n\nNow what\n\nOrdinarily, that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem. A \"delisted\" stock could still at least trade over the counter (OTC) in the U.S. -- albeit with less liquidity and probably at a depressed valuation. But the Senate bill in question, unless amended when voted on in the House, appears to forbid stocks that violate the bill's mandates from trading OTC, too. This could put 51jobs shareholders in something of a bind. Technically, they'd still own the stock -- but practically, they'd have no easy way to sell it after the law passes.\n\nNo wonder investors are selling today, before the law gets a chance to pass."}, "no_of_news": 1}, "YY": {"company_name": "JOYY Inc.", "News 1": {"title": "JOYY Reports First Quarter 2020 Unaudited Financial Results", "keywords": ["quarter", "reports", "results", "million", "net", "income", "period", "2019", "unaudited", "nongaap", "joyy", "financial", "2020"], "publish_date": "2020-05-20", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/joyy-reports-first-quarter-2020-220010814.html", "summary": "First Quarter 2020 Financial HighlightsFirst Quarter 2020 Operational HighlightsMr. David Xueling Li, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JOYY, commented, \u201cFirst and foremost, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our global teams.\nJOYY uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net margin attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc., and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS, which are non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. as a percentage of net revenues.\nAfter the non-GAAP reconciliation, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interests of JOYY Inc. is equal to the non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc.\n9 Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. as a percentage of net revenues.", "text": "GUANGZHOU, China, May 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JOYY Inc. (YY) (\u201cJOYY\u201d or the \u201cCompany,\u201d formerly known as YY Inc.), a global video-based social media platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2020.\n\nFirst Quarter 2020 Financial Highlights\n\nFirst Quarter 2020 Operational Highlights\n\nMr. David Xueling Li, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JOYY, commented, \u201cFirst and foremost, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our global teams. Your resilience, ingenuity, and dedication have enabled us to continue delivering strong operating and financial results despite the global challenging macro environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nMr. Li continued, \u201cDuring the first quarter, our dual-engine growth strategy of combining living streaming with short-form videos continued to produce good results across all of our business segments. Bigo Live, our global live streaming platform, achieved 37.8% year-over-year MAU growth with our continuous global expansion. Driven by the rapid growth of Bigo Live in the developed market, the live streaming revenues of Bigo segment increased 92.4% to RMB1,972.3 million (US$278.5 million) in the first quarter. 6 Also, Likee, our global short-form video platform, grew its MAUs by 121.9% year over year as it accelerated its expansion in developed markets and further strengthened its leading position in the key developing markets. In addition, Hago is entering into a new growth phase to become a vibrant social network platform for young generation with solid progress in monetization. Meanwhile, YY Live further cemented its domestic market leadership in China by launching innovative virtual entertainment events and upgrading its live streaming content. Looking ahead, as the consumption of live streaming and short-form video services becomes increasingly prevalent around the globe, we aim to stay at the forefront of this growth surge as we continue to build technology platforms, connect users, offer more diverse and tailored content, and bring joyful and youthful experiences to people everywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Bing Jin, Chief Financial Officer of JOYY, further commented, \u201cWe started the year with solid first quarter results despite increasing macroeconomic uncertainties. During the first quarter, we grew our total revenues by 49.6% year over year to RMB7,149.4 million, exceeding the high-end of our previous guidance. For now, the adverse impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic to our operation have been relatively mild, as the demand for online entertainment content and engaging social media networks remained resilient. We are confident that our abundant cash reserves, efficient operations, and prudent investment approach have laid a solid foundation for our next phase of global growth and attractive shareholder returns.\u201d\n\nFirst Quarter 2020 Financial Results\n\nNET REVENUES\n\nNet revenues increased by 49.6% to RMB7,149.4 million (US$1,009.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB4,780.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily driven by an increase in live streaming revenues and the contribution from the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nLive streaming revenues increased by 50.6% to RMB6,756.3 million (US$954.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB4,485.0 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily attributable to the continued live streaming revenues growth in both Huya segment and Bigo segment.\n\nOther revenues increased by 33.0% to RMB393.2 million (US$55.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB295.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily driven by the increase in advertising revenues from Bigo.\n\nCOST OF REVENUES AND GROSS PROFIT\n\nCost of revenues increased by 56.5% to RMB4,945.8 million (US$698.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB3,160.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Revenue-sharing fees and content costs increased to RMB3,549.4 million (US$501.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB2,524.7 million in the corresponding period of 2019 as a result of the increase in live streaming revenues of the Company. Bandwidth costs increased to RMB528.1 million (US$74.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB297.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019, as the overseas user base and time spent continued to expand following the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nStory continues\n\nGross profit increased by 36.0% to RMB2,203.6 million (US$311.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB1,620.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Gross margin was 30.8% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 33.9% in the corresponding period of 2019. The gross margin contraction was primarily caused by the fact that Huya and Bigo segments had lower gross margins but contributed significantly greater portions of net revenues in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nOPERATING INCOME\n\nOperating expenses were RMB2,049.4 million (US$289.4 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB1,215.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Among the operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses increased to RMB1,038.8 million (US$146.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB 534.2 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily due to the Company\u2019s increased efforts in sales and marketing activities in overseas markets and the impact of depreciation and amortization related to the consolidation of Bigo. Research and development expenses increased to RMB722.2 million (US$102.0 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB 404.7 million in the corresponding period of 2019, mostly due to the increase in salaries caused primarily by the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nOperating income was RMB186.4 million (US$26.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB473.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Operating margin was 2.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 9.9% in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily due to the decrease in gross margin, the impact of depreciation and amortization related to the consolidation of Bigo and other overseas expansion initiatives.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income7 was RMB613.2 million (US$86.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB717.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Non-GAAP operating margin8 was 8.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 15.0% in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nNET INCOME\n\nNet income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. was RMB386.7 million (US$54.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB3,120.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Net margin was 5.4% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 65.3% in the corresponding period of 2019. The high net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. and high net margin in the first quarter of 2019 were mainly due to the remeasurement gain of the Company\u2019s previously held interests in Bigo amounting to RMB2,669.3 million. The higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily due to the profit (loss) structure and the different effective tax rates of YY, Huya and Bigo segments. Particularly, the Company did not receive much benefit from losses incurred by Bigo as a majority of Bigo\u2019s business was subject to a low applicable tax rate in its jurisdiction.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. was RMB428.9 million (US$60.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB653.5 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Non-GAAP net margin9 was 6.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 13.7% in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nNET INCOME PER ADS\n\nDiluted net income per ADS10 was RMB4.49 (US$0.63) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB44.55 in the corresponding period of 2019. The high diluted net income per ADS in the first quarter of 2019 was mainly due to the remeasurement gain of the Company\u2019s previously held interests in Bigo amounting to RMB2,669.3 million.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS11 was RMB4.80 (US$0.68) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB9.32 in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, restricted short-term deposits and short-term investments of RMB26,567.1 million (US$3,752.0 million). For the first quarter of 2020, net cash from operating activities was RMB373.7 million (US$52.8 million).\n\nSHARES OUTSTANDING\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company had a total of 1,610.4 million common shares, or the equivalent of 80.5 million ADSs, outstanding.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nThis forecast no longer takes the operating results of Huya into account as the Company no longer consolidates the operating results of HUYA Inc. For the second quarter of 2020, the Company expects net revenues to be between RMB5.00 billion and RMB5.15 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 16.7% to 20.2%, excluding the revenue contribution from Huya in the same period of last year. This forecast considers the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and reflects the Company\u2019s current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change, particularly as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 on the economy in China and elsewhere.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn April 3, 2020, the Company announced that it had transferred 16,523,819 Class B ordinary shares of HUYA Inc. to Linen Investment Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited (\u201cTencent\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$262.6 million in cash, pursuant to Tencent\u2019s exercise of its option to purchase additional shares of Huya from the Company. The purchase price was determined based on the average closing prices of Huya\u2019s American depositary shares in the last 20 trading days prior to the receipt of Tencent\u2019s written exercise notice by JOYY and Huya in accordance with Huya\u2019s second amended and restated shareholders agreement dated March 8, 2018. As a result of the closing of the share transfer, Tencent increased its voting power in Huya to 50.1% on a fully-diluted basis, or 50.9% calculated based on the total issued and outstanding shares of Huya. Upon the completion of the share transfer, Huya Inc. ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company and the Company will account for the investment in Huya using the equity method. As a result, the Company no longer consolidates financial statements of Huya, starting from the second quarter of 2020. The financial information of Huya will be presented in discontinued operations and will not be presented as a separate segment starting from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe Company today announced that its board of directors has authorized to extend its existing share repurchase plan, as previously approved by the board of directors in August 2019, for another 12-month period upon its original expiry date under which the Company may repurchase up to US$300 million of its shares between August 2019 and August 2021. The share repurchases may continue to be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. JOYY\u2019s board of directors will review the share repurchase plan periodically, and may authorize adjustment of its terms and size. The Company expects to fund repurchases made under this plan from its existing funds. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had repurchased approximately US$45.4 million of its shares.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Wednesday, May 20, 2020, at 9:00 P.M.

JOYY uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net margin attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc., and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP operating income is operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, and gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income is net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, and income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items. Non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. is net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. is net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries\u2019 preferred shareholders and income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. After the non-GAAP reconciliation, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interests of JOYY Inc. is equal to the non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS is non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per ADS. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of above reconciling items adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measure for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the non-cash effect of (i) share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business, (ii) impairment of goodwill and investments, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, and accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries\u2019 preferred shareholders, which may not be recurring in its business, and (iii) income tax expenses and non-GAAP adjustments for net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders, which are affected by above non-GAAP reconciling items. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company\u2019s net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \u201cJOYY Inc.

These adjustments amounted to RMB42.2 million (US$6.0 million) and reversal of RMB2,466.9 million in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Please refer to the section titled \u201cReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\u201d for more details.\n\n4 Refers to mobile average monthly active users.

Each ADS represents twenty Class A common shares of the Company. Diluted net income per ADS is net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS.\n\n11 Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of diluted net income per ADS.

This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nSee our latest analysis for JOYY\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nWhile the share price declined over five years, JOYY actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 19% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.\n\nIt is unusual to see such modest share price growth in the face of sustained EPS improvements. We can look to other metrics to try to understand the situation better.\n\nIn contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 34% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:YY Income Statement May 19th 2020 More\n\nJOYY is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think JOYY will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nJOYY shareholders are down 17% for the year, but the market itself is up 2.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3.8% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - JOYY has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.\n\nBut note: JOYY may not be the best stock to buy.

Companies are starting to take reservations for August and laying out plans to launch ships in a phased manner.

He initiated Norwegian Cruise Line with an outperform rating and a $21 price target, Royal Caribbean with an outperform rating and a $67 price target, and Carnival with a $12 price target and a neutral rating.

Travel is likely to be down across the globe for the foreseeable future and while there are cruise diehards, it's the marginal customer that's going to drive profitability for the growing fleet of cruise liners in operation.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread travel restrictions have caused sailings to be suspended, sending shares to record lows. To survive, cruise operators have gone into cash preservation mode, entering into liquidity enhancing credit agreements.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are hardly lining up to pull the trigger on names within this area of the market. However, five-star analyst Benjamin Chaiken, of Credit Suisse, has a more optimistic view of the industry. He acknowledges that \u201cCOVID -19 may be the toughest challenge the industry has ever faced\u201d, with it potentially taking several years to regain pricing parity. That being said, he argues the \u201cunmatched value proposition of the product\u201d will power a rebound, and that the recent weakness presents an attractive entry point with liquidity struggles already built in.\n\nHighlighting the resiliency of the industry, Chaiken said, \"The cruise industry has bounced back before from deadly accidents, sudden regulatory changes and storms.\u201d He added, \u201cAdditionally, we think the cruise demographic is favorable for a recovery in demand, and could be why 55% of cruise customers, according to our checks, are opting for a cruise credit vs. cash, post COVID -19 disruption. We think this is a very powerful data point highlighting the resiliency in the product, and speaks volumes in terms of future demand for the industry, especially in the context of current sentiment which questions if the product will even exist in the future.\u201d\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, Chaiken points to two cruise line stocks with especially strong long-term growth narratives, initiating coverage of each with bullish ratings. The analyst does remind clients that not all cruise industry players are set to outperform, recommending that investors avoid one in particular.\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Chaiken\u2019s calls. Here\u2019s what we found out.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL)\n\nWith 63 ships carrying approximately 6 million passengers every year, Royal Caribbean counts itself as one of the top cruise ship operators. While COVID-19 has certainly taken a toll on the company, Chaiken believes that when demand recovers, RCL will be a major beneficiary.\n\nThe Credit Suisse analyst argues that part of the company\u2019s strength is derived from the location in which it operates cruises. \u201cWe think the Caribbean \u2013where RCL is best positioned in terms of capacity allocation and product--could be a bright spot when demand does return. Many Caribbean itineraries require little or no air travel to embarkation, which we think is likely a positive for those with remaining fear over air travel,\u201d he explained. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that \u201cRCL has the ability to market to guests with a shorter booking window.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Chaiken implores investors to take RCL\u2019s performance before the onset of the public health crisis into account. \"We think RCL was gaining significant momentum heading into the Coronavirus-led slowdown, with its CocoCay destination (a private island in the Bahamas offering differentiated land-based activities), demanding price premiums and an had been planning an 80% increase in volume in 2020 vs. 2019, prior to the outbreak,\u201d the analyst stated. He added, \u201cRCL finished 2019 at 108% occupancy and reported net yields of 8%.\u201d\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Chaiken expects several potential tailwinds to emerge post-COVID-19. Its acquisition of Silversea added two ships to the fleet and expanded its agent network, providing a tailwind to yields. Cost tailwinds could also be in RCL\u2019s future.\n\nEven though liquidity and cash burn are considered by some to be a cause for concern, Chaiken is optimistic. \u201cRCL recently raised $3.3 billion in secured notes, giving us further confidence that they should be able to manage the slowdown,\u201d he noted.\n\nTo this end, Chaiken kicked off his RCL coverage by publishing an Outperform rating. Accompanying the bullish call is a $67 price target, which suggests 55% upside potential. (To watch Chaiken\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nLooking at the consensus breakdown, the bulls have it. RCL\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. At $60.36, the average price target implies 39% upside potential.

Reporting from the Washington Post and the Miami Herald shows as many as 65 people may have died after being exposed to the coronavirus onboard cruise ships.\n\nIn late March, the CDC recommended deferring all cruise travel during the pandemic.\n\nEarlier this month, however, cruise operators indicated that by the end of the summer they expect to have ships embarking on cruises and executives from multiple cruise companies have indicated positive booking trends.\n\nAnd analysts at Credit Suisse led by Benjamin Chaiken think now is the time to Buy.\n\nIn a note to clients published Thursday, Chaiken initiated coverage of the three major cruise operators \u2014 Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival Cruises (CCL) \u2014 putting an Outperform rating on Royal and Norwegian and a Neutral rating on Carnival. Credit Suisse put a $67 price target on Royal shares, a $21 price target on Norwegian stock, and a $12 target on shares of Carnival.\n\nShares of Royal and Norwegian rose more than 8% on Thursday following the news; Carnival shares rose over 3%. All three stocks are still down more than 65% this year.\n\nIn Chaiken\u2019s view, the case for these stocks comes down to two big factors \u2014 financial health and consumer demand.\n\n\u201c[Cruise stocks] are at all-time lows, and all three operators are now in cash preservation mode, having entered into liquidity enhancing credit agreements,\u201d Chaiken writes. \u201cWith the risk of a liquidity crunch partially priced in, we think current levels offer an attractive entry point. We believe CCL has 9 months of liquidity (good through the end of November), NCLH ~27 months, and RCL ~12+ months.\u201d\n\nIn other words, none of these companies are at imminent risk of running out of cash after the initial phase of this pandemic appeared to pose an existential threat to the business. Surviving the next few months, however, does not make for a great thesis on its own.\n\nFor that, Chaiken digs into what cruises actually offer consumers: affordable vacations.\n\n\u201cWhile COVID-19 will likely have a lasting impact on the cruise industry, which will potentially take years to regain pricing parity, we think the unmatched value proposition of the product will be a driving force behind a recovery,\u201d Chaiken writes.\n\n\u201cA cruise includes accommodations, activities, meals, and often drinks, at a 50-70% discount to many other types of vacations. We are unable to think of a vacation alternative that involves international travel, multiple locations, entertainment (from live shows to shore excursions), and resort-like amenities at this price point. We believe this is a primary reason cruise demand has rebounded after past slowdowns, with demand returning in ~8-10 months per our estimates.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse's work suggests cruises offer consumers a significant discount to land-based alternatives. (Source: Credit Suisse) More\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s rough math suggests a Caribbean cruise from New Yotk offers a tropical vacation at about 1/3 the cost of flying to the Bahamas. And, yes, of course these trips aren\u2019t exactly equivalent and a few-hours-long pit stop on an island doesn\u2019t replace the experience of walking a few steps to the beach.\n\nBut a $700 vacation is accessible to a far larger number of consumers than a $2,000-plus vacation. And when consumer concerns about safety are addressed and pandemic fears subside, that value isn\u2019t going to go away, in Credit Suisse\u2019s view."}, "News 6": {"title": "Why Norwegian Cruise Line's Stock Is Moving Higher Today", "keywords": ["stock", "lines", "shares", "cruise", "norwegian", "line", "moving", "today", "higher", "credit", "suisse", "trading", "2020"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-norwegian-cruise-lines-stock-160409245.html", "summary": "Norwegian Cruise Line (NASDAQ: NCLH) shares are trading higher on Thursday.\nCredit Suisse initiated coverage on the company's stock with an Outperform rating and announced a $21 price target.\nThe shares of several cruise companies are also trading higher, potentially amid cautious optimism towards a rebound in travel demand.\nNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths, operating 28 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising.\nNorwegian Cruise Line shares were trading up 7.11% at $13.71 on Thursday.", "text": "Norwegian Cruise Line (NASDAQ: NCLH) shares are trading higher on Thursday.

Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.\n\n\u201cNothing like this has happened before, this is China\u2019s gambit to win the global tech race,\u201d said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. \u201cStarting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.\u201d\n\nThe tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China\u2019s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country\u2019s worst economic performance since the Mao era.\n\nThe nation\u2019s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.\n\nMaria Kwok\u2019s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant\u2019s payment is late.\n\nChina is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There\u2019s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with \u201cdumb\u201d bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.\n\nWhat BloombergNEF Says\n\nChina\u2019s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens.

Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its \u201cNew Deal\u201d to create jobs and boost growth.\n\nAccording to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail. More than 20 of mainland China\u2019s 31 provinces and regions have announced projects totaling over 1 trillion yuan with active participation from private capital, a state-backed newspaper reported Wednesday.\n\nSeparate estimates by Morgan Stanley put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings, Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.\n\nStory continues"}, "News 5": {"title": "Lebanon seeks foreign government-backed financing for power plants after default", "keywords": ["companies", "sovereign", "seeks", "default", "told", "tom", "foreign", "financing", "ghajar", "governmentbacked", "oil", "reforms", "plants", "lebanon", "seen", "power"], "publish_date": "2020-05-20", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lebanon-seeks-foreign-government-backed-174926548.html", "summary": "\"The default has caused a significant financability problem for infrastructure projects in Lebanon.\n\"We talked to the four companies ... they all expressed interest of their governments to finance such projects,\" Ghajar told Reuters.\nForeign donors see it as a test of Beirut's will to enact long-delayed reforms that may in turn help unlock their aid.\nThe companies would have conditions attached to their financing, which is expected to come from export credit agencies.\nEXPENSIVE GENERATORSThe country has failed to provide 24-hour power since the war, leaving households reliant on expensive private generators.", "text": "* Lebanon defaulted on sovereign debt in March\n\n* Power reform seen as critical to fixing state finances\n\n* Lebanon to negotiate with four firms on possible arrangements\n\nBy Tom Perry\n\nBEIRUT, May 20 (Reuters) - Lebanon has turned to global power plant manufacturers including General Electric to arrange financing to build badly needed electricity capacity, hoping favourable terms can be agreed with help from their governments.\n\nEnergy Minister Raymond Ghajar told Reuters on Wednesday that Lebanon had modified its approach to the process since it defaulted on its sovereign debt in March, meaning it was unable to offer the kind of sovereign guarantee sought by investors.\n\n\"The default has caused a significant financability problem for infrastructure projects in Lebanon.

If this was not enough, tariffs would need to be restructured, Ghajar said.\n\nDonors want a regulatory authority established as part of the reforms. The government is working on amendments to a law for establishing it, which parliament must then ratify.\n\nGhajar also said interest in Lebanon's second offshore oil and gas exploration licensing round, which closes on June 1, had not been very high.\n\nMost firms are not interested in exploration as budgets have been cut due to low oil prices and the new coronavirus, he said.

Hello everyone, thank you for joining our earnings call today. We have finished an extraordinary quarter and have delivered an outstanding fiscal year. Despite the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Alibaba achieved a historical milestone of $1 trillion in GMV across our digital economy this fiscal year, a strategic goal that we set for ourselves five years ago. We at Alibaba have always been aiming for the stars while keeping our feet on the ground. The $1 trillion GMV milestone reflects the [Indecipherable] of Alibaba's digital economy and as well as strong execution at the end and a clear strategic vision. Our sale has now reached one-sixth of China's total retail sales, which was about $6 million last year and we believe there is still tremendous potential for growth.\n\nDigital adoption and transformation in retail are accelerating due to the COVID-19 pandemic reshaping consumer behavior and enterprise operations. On the consumer side shopping online has become a habit for more people and in more product categories. On the retail side, online sales is no longer an option, but a necessity for the brick-and-mortars. We believe this is a new normal that will stay even after the pandemic is over.\n\nI would like to review the past quarter's performance in the context of the impact and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 23 -- on January 23, right before the Chinese New Year holiday, China announced the lockdown of Wuhan, the center of the pandemic. The lockdown measures implemented in other provinces and cities led to large scale economic disruption in late January and February, which negatively affected our domestic e-commerce business during the period. However, China quickly contained the pandemic by implementing measures such as strict social distancing, mass testing coverage, centralized mobilization of medical resources, and started to reopen the country for business in late February. By March 9, China had full recovery of logistic operation national wide except for Hubei province where Wuhan is and normal life began to return for most of the people in the country when in Wuhan, the 10 weeks lockdown was lifted on April 8. Since March, we have seen a healthy recovery in our China retail marketplaces. As of March 31, 2020 active consumers on our China retail marketplaces reached 726 million, a net increase of 15 million versus the previous quarter.\n\nMobile MAUs of our China retail marketplaces reached 846 million in March 2020, an increase of 22 million over December 2019. This reflects how strong consumer mindshare and healthy user stickiness. Since the new fiscal year began in April, the quarter-to-date paid GMV of our China retail marketplaces has experienced year-on-year growth at a similar rate to the December quarter's level. For the past several years, we have been investing to grow our new retail business in fresh food and grocery, Freshippo and Taoxianda, which have played an important role in supplying daily necessities to people impacted during the pandemic and it has become wildly popular among consumers.\n\nIn the past quarter both Freshippo and Taoxianda delivered stellar growth of more than 100% year-on-year. Approximately 60% of Freshippo's GMV came from online orders up by 10 percentage points year-over-year. As lockdown measures eased in China starting in April demand and the popularity of our grocery business have remained strong. We believe the consumer habit of buying fresh food and groceries online will continue after the pandemic and online and offline integration will drive the new retail model to the next stage of development. We have been investing for years to build a new retail tech knowledge infrastructure, which will help us further strengthen our market leadership in this sector.\n\nAs the leading cross-border import platform in China, Tmall Global has become an ever more important destination for Chinese consumers to buy imported products as they could not travel abroad during the pandemic. The market outside of China, our international retail marketplaces such as Lazada and AliExpress attracted over 180 million annual active consumers as of March 2020. Lazada's order volume grew more than 100% year-on-year during the fiscal year and completed the March quarter with a strong finish despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring February and March 2020, our cross-border marketplace, AliExpress GMV growth was negatively impacted mainly by the supply chain and the logistic disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We are seeing signs of recovery in certain major markets starting in April, but there are still uncertainties ahead.\n\nRevenue from our local consumer services business decreased by 8% year-on-year in the past quarter due to the impact of COVID-19. In April, year-on-year growth of our food delivery GMV turned positive as lockdown measures eased, restaurants began reopening and people began returning to work in China.\n\nAlibaba Cloud continued its rapid growth in the past fiscal year with revenue reaching RMB40 billion, an increase of 62% year-on-year. During the pandemic, our public cloud business grew rapidly driven by increased consumption of video content as well as wide adoption of remote working and learning. Our cloud computing infrastructure and fixed data business have also played a key role in enabling businesses to quickly resume operation and production. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate digital transformation of enterprises. All industries including public sectors will choose to move their technology infrastructure to the cloud.\n\nDingTalk, our digital collaboration platform for enterprises played a key role during the pandemic. Millions of more enterprises and users in China are now using DingTalk to stay connected and work remotely. DingTalk also made significant penetration in the education sector as schools adopt the platform for their teachers and students. In March 2020, DingTalk conducted an average of over one million active classroom sections on each school day.\n\nDingTalk's number of daily average active consumers during a working day grew significantly to 155 million in March. As offices and schools reopen in China, DingTalk's number of active users came down from the peak level, but still maintain at more than 100 million DAU. In the past quarter, our digital media and entertainment business delivered healthy growth in paying subscribers and the user time spent as users' consumption of video content increased significantly during the pandemic.\n\nYouku will continue its focus on production and distribution of original and exclusive content while ensuring cost efficiencies and return on investment. During the past quarter, we leveraged our platform technology and other resources across the Alibaba ecosystem to support population impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic within China and around the world. We also implemented a comprehensive set of financial and business support measures to help alleviate the near-term challenge faced by our business customers and partners.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020. Alibaba together with Ant Financial have contributed approximately RMB3.4 billion in value in the form of donations, subsidies, and tech support. To name a few examples we waived fees, reduced commissions, and offered logistics subsidies to our merchants. We work with Ant Financial and other partners to advance working capital funds for our merchants to provide liquidity and to facilitate one-year loans with preferential interest rates. We use the RMB1 billion special fund we established in January to procure medical and related supplies for parts of China affected by the pandemic.\n\nOur logistics subsidiary, Cainiao offered free delivery of medical supplies to destinations around the world through its extensive global logistics network. Our self-operated fresh food and grocery chain, Freshippo committed to more than 200 remaining open for business even during the period when lockdown measures were in effect. Freshippo also worked with the supply chain to keep our commitment to not raising prices as well as maintaining adequate stock on the shelves.\n\nWe made available AI technology for over 550 hospitals in China to help in improving the speed and efficiency of their COVID-19 diagnosis during CT lung scans. The Ali Baba Foundation through combined efforts with Jack Ma Foundation and the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation donated over 200 million units of personal protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators to over 150 countries and regions.\n\nIn April 2020, we further announced the 2020 Spring Thunder initiative, which aims to help export-oriented SMEs to explore opportunities in the China domestic market through our China retail marketplaces and expand into new markets through our international, wholesale, and retail marketplaces such as alibaba.com and AliExpress; to develop digitalized manufacturing clusters, to accelerate the digital transformation of China's agriculture sector; and alleviate financing challenges faced by SMEs by working with Ant Financial and its partners.\n\nThe battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, although China has made good progress in fighting and controlling the spread of the coronavirus with most business reopening and the people returning to normal life, the threat of the pandemic is still looming in the rest of the world and the timing and the pace of recovery is still uncertain.\n\nAt the same time tensions between the U.S. and China have added another layer of uncertainty to the post-COVID-19 world. Despite the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and the geopolitical environment. There is one thing weak and certain, the world is moving toward digital-first and digital everything. In the past two decades, Alibaba has developed comprehensive infrastructure and capabilities, built on digital technology for business, financial services, logistics, cloud computing and big data to prepare for this new era. We believe our infrastructure and capabilities will play an important role in enabling all industries to embrace digital transformation and the customers to embrace a digital lifestyle.\n\nIn addition, we aim to empower SMEs around the world including both in America to have access to the Chinese and other global consumer markets and create new jobs. This is a task that Alibaba must undertake to fulfill our vision to make it easy to do business anywhere and it is also the fundamental assurance for our sustainable growth in the future.\n\nNow I will turn it over to Maggie, who will walk you through the details of our financial results.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategic Investments\n\nThank you, everyone, and Daniel.\n\nI'd like to start with prepared remarks by addressing COVID-19's impact on our financials and recent trends. Back in February given the potential uncertainties of COVID-19 pandemic, we guided the market that our overall revenue growth rate would be negatively impacted for the March quarter and that some of the businesses, such as China retail marketplaces and local consumer services might show negative revenue growth. I'm pleased to report we delivered better than expected March quarter results.\n\nThe government took effective measures to limit the spread of the virus through lockdown, social distancing measures, and travel restrictions. With the virus spread under control in China, these restrictions started to ease in early March and this led to a recovery of supply chain and logistic delivery capacity. This in turn enabled a quick recovery for our China retail marketplaces and improving fundamentals for local consumer service businesses.\n\nFor our China retail marketplaces, Tmall online physical goods GMV, excluding unpaid orders, grew 10% in the March quarter. Although only 10% growth, we did see robust demand of FMCG and consumer electronics categories as home furnishing consumers cooked at home and upgraded home appliances and [Indecipherable] products. These two categories combined grew 25% on our Tmall platform.\n\nOn the other hand, discretionary product categories such as apparel and accessories, home furnishing, and auto parts experienced negative growth. Starting in April, Tmall online physical goods GMV saw strong growth, a strong recovery, and has continued to further improve in May.\n\nLocal consumer services recorded 8% decline in revenue this quarter reflecting mass closures of restaurants and the local merchants. However, social distancing measures also led to increased demand for groceries and other daily necessities. Starting in April, GMV growth of food delivery businesses turned positive as lockdown measures eased. Restaurants began reopening and people began returning to work in China.\n\nFor our international commerce business, which represents around 7% of total revenue in fiscal 2020, the timing and pace of the recovery is uncertain as demand in countries outside China may be further impacted by COVID-19.\n\nSo let's take a look at the March quarter financial highlights. Our total revenue was RMB114 billion, it grew by 22% year-over-year. The increase was mainly driven by the growth of the China commerce retail business especially new retail businesses in grocery category and cloud computing. We continue to be successful at expanding product offerings on our platform that cater to the needs of different consumer segments.\n\nThe decrease of non-GAAP free cash flow was due to a one-off of AliExpress payment service restructuring. For this, we had full disclosure of this in our earnings release. This is mainly due to the overseas regulation requirement change as AliExpress began the process of restructure so that it no longer hosts consumer funds before they are released to the merchants. If we take that impact out our non-GAAP free cash flow would have been over RMB2 billion.\n\nLet's take a look at the revenue in detail. China commerce retail goods 21%; customer management revenue grew 3%. The growth of customer management revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue from recommendation fees and Taobao Live. This new revenue stream partially offset by a decrease in volume of day clicks and average unit price per click. These are the big plate and PPC, I'm talking about is for the search business P2P, so this is impacted because of COVID-19.\n\nCommission revenue decreased 2% primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 impact. These impacts including cancellation of some orders as a result of logistic disruptions in February, weakness in apparel categories, our waiver of annual service fees for the first half of 2020 as part of our support to merchant customers.\n\nIn the national retail revenue grew 8% to RMB5.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to the growth of Lazada and Trendyol and partially offset by the exclusion of revenue from AliExpress Russia which was no longer consolidated since October 2019. So we have a JV in Russia right now. Cainiao's revenue reached RMB5 billion growing at 28% year-on-year. This was primarily due to the increase in the volume of orders fulfilled from our fast-growing cross-border and international commerce retail businesses. And our local consumer service experienced negative growth this quarter, I just talked about. So for Ali Cloud, it's still growing strongly at 58%, and let's take a look at the March quarter cost trend. Cross-border revenue excluding SBC was 62% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to a revenue mix shift toward direct sales businesses, the new retail businesses, such as our new retail and also as consolidation of Kaola, and partially offset by a decrease in delivery cost of our local consumer services.\n\nLet's turn to segment profitability. Our market-based core commerce adjusted EBITDA reached RMB34 billion, decreased 2%, but core commerce adjusted EBITDA grew 2% to RMB28 billion. This is because losses in our four strategic commerce initiatives were narrowed compared to the prior year driven by the ongoing improvement of China logistic network, higher demand for Freshippo, and the lower variable costs required for our local consumer service business.\n\nNow I would like to mention about the innovation initiatives. When you look, the adjusted EBITDA loss was RMB3.1 billion, which is up from RMB1.9 billion from a year ago. The increase was primarily due to our aggressive investment in net income to provide remote work collaborations capabilities to enterprises and the schools free of charge during the COVID-19. As a result, daily active users on DingTalk achieved a fourfold increase to over 100 million, a peak at about 155 million.\n\nSo March quarter, our international financial, the share of results of equity in SBC in the quarter reached 3.5 billion. The year-over-year increase in shares of the results of the equity investee was mainly due to our share of profits and financials in December quarter as we take it's profit in one-quarter lag, partially offset by used by a decrease in our share of results of Suning.\n\nMarch quarter GAAP to non-GAAP net income, the GAAP net income attributable to shareholders was RMB3.2 billion. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a net loss in investment income mainly reflecting decreases in the market prices of our equity investments in publicly traded companies compared to net gain recorded in the same quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders increased by 12% to RMB25 billion.\n\nNow let's look at the physical 2020 full-year results. GMV as Daniel mentioned, the Alibaba digital economy achieved an important milestone of $1 trillion GMV, a target you probably remember that this is a target we committed to do five years to six years ago. User growth, annual active consumers in China reached 780 million including 726 million of China retail marketplaces. In other words one out of every two Chinese are buying our platform.\n\n780 million of annual active consumers in China account for around 85% and 40% of the Chinese population in developed and the less developed areas. Our ability to attract users at a rapid pace reflects not only the diversity of product selection but also the platform has become an everyday destination for entertainment and discovery of new trends.\n\nWe continue to achieve strong revenue growth across all businesses including core commerce, cloud computing, and other business. So total revenue grew 35% to RMB510 billion. To talk about the possibility in the last 12 months we grew adjusted EBITDA by 28% to RMB137 billion and generated RMB131 billion in non-GAAP free cash flow. This is a significant firepower for our long-term growth.\n\nOkay. Let's turn to our business segments. All of the revenue we've talked about for each sector showed strong growth and then when you look at the adjusted EBITDA profit for the core are still growing strongly and the investment areas that these businesses, which are in the investment stage are progressing very well and loss gets narrowed.\n\nOkay. So I would like to talk about our outlook, but before that I want to address the recent bill passed by the U.S. Senate called The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The proposed legislation would essentially prohibit a foreign issuer from being listed on a U.S. Stock Exchange, if the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, this is PCAOB is enabled to inspect all the work papers of the issuers' auditors for three consecutive years due to certain reasons. We will closely monitor the development of this bill and I think it's important for investors to understand Alibaba's practice and issues raised under this proposed legislation.\n\nFirst, there is an existing framework of the PCAOB conduct -- and the PCAOB and for its conduct an inspection of audit companies with Chinese operations. In this regard, we understand that there has been ongoing dialog among the big four accounting firms China's securities regulator CSRC, SEC, and PCAOB.\n\nWith respect to the types of information that are permitted to be exchanged to issuers with Chinese operations while maintaining compliance with Chinese law.\n\nNumber two, Alibaba's financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and since our inception in 1999, we have been audited by PwC Hong Kong, PwC Hong Kong is the local affiliate of the worldwide PWC firm and its auditing standards are overseen by the PwC national office in the United States. The integrity of Alibaba's financial statements speaks for itself. We have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the high standards of transparency. Each year we have received -- and qualified by the opinion of our financial statements from PwC.\n\nThird, trust is one of our core values and transparency and integrity are essential components of building trust with all of our stakeholders. All these years we have consistently aimed to grow the business for long-term, maintain compliance with all applicable laws and delivered value for our customers, employees and investors. Investors who bought our stock in 2014 IPO have tripled their investment over the past five and a half years.\n\nGiven the above, we will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities of U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nLooking ahead despite a challenging quarter due to pandemic, we achieved our guidance of over $500 billion in revenue and delivered healthy, sustainable profit growth in fiscal year 2020. The reason we have been able to deliver these results is that we sowed seeds years ago by investing in technology, in innovation, and in businesses that required far sight and long-term patients. Today the Alibaba digital economy remains strong and growing.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue the same strategy of delivering robust revenue growth and sustainable profit growth. Although it is difficult to predict the uncertainty of global economic and geopolitical developments. Based on our current view of Chinese domestic consumption and enterprise digitization, we expect to generate over RMB650 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We believe our commitment to invest and deepen our value proposition to customers, thereby ensuring robust revenue and profit growth.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open for Q&A. Thank you.\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Maggie. However, as this is our earnings call, you are welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English. A third party translator will provide consecutive interpretation for the Q&A session. As our management will address your questions in the language you asked. Please note that the translation is for convenience purposes only, in the case of any discrepancies our management statement in the original language.\n\nSo, operator, I'd like to open it up for questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session.\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOperator?\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Binnie Wong from HSBC. Please ask your question.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you, Daniel, Maggie, and Rob. My question is regarding your strategy in lower to your cities, I note that last week you issued a new release and new patch release for Taobao providing new support for merchants as well as other new features and 70% of the uptake for that new patch release has in fact been from the lower-tier cities. So can you speak to us about your strategy going forward for the lower-tier cities?\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you and I will take that question. Given the size and the scale of Taobao as a retail platform and where it's out today at $700 million. The fact is that we've penetrated all segments of the market from the high-end down to the low-end and the increase in the user base over the past year 70 million, 70% of that came from the lower-tier cities.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. So what we're doing in the lower-tier cities is deploying a more diverse and broad range of different services including on Taobao with more value for money offerings as well as live streaming and other kinds of engagement that are targeted for those users, especially those who are looking for good value for money. And as you've noted, we have a new special price addition of Taobao which is targeted for those are users in lower-tier cities with a focus on giving them value for money offerings.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nAt the same time, we see significant potential for further growing our user base, the current figure for annual active consumers 780 million represents only 45% penetration of the population in lower-tier cities and in the rural areas of China, so there still is lots of room to grow in those regions and we intend to do so together with Alipay in driving a digitalization strategy in those areas that will convert people into consumers. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. My question is regarding the long-term impact of live streaming on the industry and in particular celebrity host and KOL live streaming. The question is if merchants need to pay these celebrities, these KOLs will that impact on the profitability of our platform going forward.\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. And that's a really good question. What we're seeing really is the emergence of live streaming as a new kind of sales methodology or new kind of sales channel with the emergence of these KOLs and celebrity influencers online, the role that they're really playing in the context of retail is sales. They are serving as salespeople and they make money by way of a sales commission.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nIn the long-term, how this trend will play out I think it really comes down to whether the intrinsic commercial value in terms of having online influence with some KOLs to live streaming be fully captured in an efficient and effective way. If you have a one-off sales event with a celebrity influencer, you get a user to make a one-off purchase, fine, but the question is can you then keep that user in the long-term and continue to market to them and get the full value out of that relationship. So I think it's important if you're paying money to these online influencers or celebrities that you're converting, in part that's about supplanting existing channel costs and saving costs there. But more importantly, it's about getting the new consumer into your ecosystem, so they can become a long-term consumer. And this is critical to Ali Baba because we are a diversified ecosystem with multiple channels and formats for engaging consumers. So that's precisely what we are looking at doing with these kinds of live streaming approaches. It's just one part of an overall integrated approach through which we hope to develop those long-term relationships and create long-term value.\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOkay. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nPiyush Mubayi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my question. I have one question with regards to the guidance you provided for next year. What are the drivers of that growth assumption of guidance you provided and in particular what are the underlying macro assumptions you've made and more generally, the platform mix that you're likely the 1P versus 3P mix that you're likely to see that's underpinning that guidance? Thank you. I'll go back to the queue afterward.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategic Investments\n\nOkay. Piyush this is Maggie. Let me try to answer your question. So we all know that we're facing risks and uncertainties, right. So, many of which we are not able to predict or control, so whether they're going to be a second wave or when will that come, how much impact will the geopolitical issue bring. We know it's hard for us to factor in. So the guidance we give basically reflects the assumption that we believe to be reasonable today.\n\nSo Daniel talked about the recovery seed of each of our businesses and particularly for like China retail local service and international business etc. So based on what we've seen today and we see this quarter-to-date transaction volume and also user activities etc have already experienced similar growth at a similar rate to the December quarter level. So that's the basic assumption that we used. And you mentioned about 1P, 3P, so you can see from our revenue breakdown sort of 2020 fiscal year, 1P business as a percentage of the total revenue already went up to around 15% and 17% and we believe that percentage is going to continue to go up, but not dramatically, but the important thing is that people are thinking about your revenue content as a portion of 1P, but 1P normally represents low margins, but look at our profit growth. I think this is another point, I want to make is that we are a group that has set strong growth for the core, and also has multiple engines, not only Taobao, Tmall, China retail marketplace, but also the new retail local services, logistics, right.\n\nSo strong revenue growth experienced for us to invest in those strategically important areas and these investment areas are doing better and better, which reflects into our office growth. Sorry, interpreter, I gave a long answer.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Yao -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. I noted in the earlier remarks, your comments about advertising revenue in the first quarter, performing well driven by a good performance of recommendation feeds. And in that context, I'd like to ask about your plans for monetization of recommendation. I imagine that in your answer you will talk about the need to balance the interests of merchants against the desire for monetization. So given that perhaps I could go ahead and just ask the second part of the question. Namely, is there any technical or technological method that could be adopted on the one hand, so as to fully protect the merchants' interests or even better serve the merchants interest while at the same time also providing more opportunity for monetization and if so is that something that could happen this year.\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. I'll start with the latter part of your question. And the answer is yes, there is a technology that can do precisely that and the technology is AI, Artificial Intelligence, which can be applied and we are already working on applying it in a way that can ensure a good user experience in terms of balancing advertised content versus free content for users and also leveraging that technology for merchants to drive better return on their investment. So we're working in this direction and I think we're already making good progress. So in general, we are moving forward cautiously and working on growing revenues from recommendation feeds and it is our hope that we can find ever better ways to do precisely what you mentioned in your question, namely finding the best possible balance, leveraging on technology between user experience and creating value for merchants.\n\nJoe Tsai -- Executive Chairman\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. I just like to add a couple of points on top of Daniel's already very clear answer. And the keyword. I'd like to add in is a multi-engine approach. So if you look at our revenue over this 3-year period. Revenue from CMR and commissions accounted for 70% compared against 40% and what this means is that our strategic investments are starting to produce new channels of revenue, new sources of revenue. So you can see this in our figures over the 3-year period for CMR as well 90% and that's down now by 20% to about 70%. So you have all of these different new revenue areas that can be tapped into including recommendations that we've talked about, but also live streaming also Suning and many other new sources of revenue. So thirdly and in conclusion going forward, yes, we will continue to, as we said on Investor Day, to take a prudent approach and moving forward with monetization.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nHi, good evening. Thanks management for taking my question. My question is more about the spending power of the buyers' post virus. Can management comment about the overall spending powerhouse of consumers these days? And with that, can you comment about the trend in ASP and all you can see that we would expect as people speeding up the migration to online. Thank you.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay. Let me answer this question. First of all, I think on our platform, we are such a huge consumer platform we have different tiers of consumers around us. So what we see is that consumers, they engage with us and find what they want in different categories, in different pricing ranges, but we do see some shift of the product categories up in this quarter because of the pandemic. For example, we see very strong growth in food and grocery business and because people, when people stay at home, they have to cook at home, they are unable to go to the restaurant, so they need more food and more groceries, which are all daily necessities. So that's why we see very strong growth in our FMCG categories and food categories.\n\nOur FMCG category grows, like, I think take an example like starting from the new fiscal year, our FMCG categories in Tmall grow nearly like, I remember 40%, around 40%, which is a very strong indicator that people spent more on our platform in these categories. Well, because of the pandemic, people spent less on like apparel or like fashion because people wear face masks and they don't even need this makeup. So I think the spending is still there, but the focus is quite different.\n\nAnd in terms of the general I mean spending power, I would say, China is a famous high saving rate country and we do see people remain in their consumption, remain in a very strong consumption power to continue their -- to maintain their lifestyle. So far we haven't seen any big change, I mean change in terms of the consumption, power, but as I said before, I think the category, the product categories they try and we do see some difference.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nLet me clarify one point. When we talk about beauty, what we see is like skincare still remained very strong. For makeup as I said when ladies wear a face mask, then the need for makeup is getting lower. So that's squeezing the situation.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nNext question. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Helfstein -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst\n\nThank you. I just want to go a little bit deeper into that last point, you said that online physical goods GMV grew 10% and then you did breakdown that, you saw a 25% in these categories that benefited were more COVID related offset by areas where they didn't spend money. What do you think is a kind of more reflective of Consumer Health? Is it that 10% number or really is it that kind of 25% and consumers have the ability right now to spend more, they're just not because they don't need the items consistent to what you talked about not needing makeup, if you're, wearing a mask for example and maybe talk about how that relates to your outlook for the next quarter? Thank you.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay. Let me answer this first. As we said before our China retail, our Tmall will grow like 10% in the March quarter and in Tmall we have our FMCG and consumer electronics. The combined growth rate in the March quarter for these categories on Tmall was about 25%. But if you want to get a big picture of the future development, I think in my remarks, I gave you a very clear, I mean our latest, I mean indicator, which is starting from the new year, the quarter-to-date, overall speaking, our China retail marketplace growth rate is similar to those in the December quarter. So I think that's basically the big picture of where we are today, but we do hold people realize understand that there is still uncertainties about containing the pandemic. So we will closely monitor the situation, but we strongly believe that the consumption power in China is still very strong, but we will take our advantage in the digital platform to continue our leading position.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nYeah, let me add one more point which is like, if you look at the past fiscal year, we generated $1 trillion GMV in Alibaba ecosystem, but if you look at our China retail marketplaces, the GMV we generated last fiscal year was about like RMB6.5 trillion and, if we look at the -- if we look at what happened in the March quarter, I think we should have achieved a higher GMV, if without this pandemic obviously. But we are very confident that in the new year, I think we will achieve another like a net add of like an RMB1 trillion -- at least RMB1 trillion GMV in our China retail marketplace, which is I think, still, a very strong number compared to the size of our business in China.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOkay. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Gregory Zhao from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory Zhao -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you and congratulations on the strong performance. My question relates to cloud services. We know that internationally players like Microsoft and Google, who have already achieved a significant scale in terms of the size and the revenues continue to be able to maintain rapid growth in their revenues and even acceleration. Looking at China, however, in the cloud space Alibaba and its competitors seem to be seeing a different trend where things are somewhat slower. So I'm wondering if you could compare for us please the China market versus the international for cloud, what are the differences underlying that picture and what are the short-term bottlenecks and how would it be possible potentially to make a big leap forward in terms of accelerating revenue and profit growth in the cloud.\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThank you. Well, first I'd like to say that in the past year Alibaba Cloud Intelligence hit a very important milestone namely reaching revenue of RMB40 billion and even in the March quarter achieving 58% growth. So we don't see a slowdown at all, we think the growth is good.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nWe see this growth coming from several different areas. One is the demand across all sectors of the economy to get on to the cloud. And if you look at Chinese IT spending, in the future we can expect to see more and more spending going forward as organizations get themselves on the cloud.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nThe second thing I would point to is that the cloud is not just a way of providing infrastructure, infrastructure on the cloud to lower IT-related operating costs. It's also an opportunity for companies to leverage on big data and cloud-enabled computing capacity to achieve better efficiencies and drive value for the business and different kinds of algorithms and analytics will be developed in the cloud for different sectors for different verticals, different product solutions to meet those needs, and unleash new value for them. So it's not just about saving costs on IT infrastructure, it's about driving value as well.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nIn Ali, the value proposition that we offer is cloud plus intelligence. So we're not just about providing cloud services, it's a combination of cloud plus intelligence. Now in different countries cloud services are defined differently, it's true in China and internationally as well. There are different definitions, but to us, it's just about shifting traffic onto the cloud to save costs, that's kind of a low-value-added offering and that's not really what Alibaba is focusing on higher value-added cloud-enabled offerings that can truly create value for clients in the sector.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nAnd finally, on your question as to the differences that we see in the Chinese cloud market versus the cloud market overseas. I would say that in the U.S. and in the more developed markets the SaaS and the whole ecosystem developers are more mature already whereas in China that developer ecosystem is just starting to get going and Alibaba very much looks forward to partner with developers to jointly create a very robust ecosystem in China.\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOkay, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nHi, good evening management. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. My question is on, so if you could give us some color that on the subsidy measure that you help provide merchants. Do you think that is actually more effective through the commission rebate or merchants actually prefer more free traffic, and given recommended fee actually becoming quite effective for merchants? So does that mean over the next few quarters we don't have to provide more preferential commission over time or is that a separate thing and the CMI and commission growth direction will still be a bit of that work? Thank you.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAlicia, let me first answer your question. I think, first of all, we are trying to help our merchants especially SMEs during this pandemic. But we have to, first of all, we have to give a very fair and transparent policy for all the merchants on our platform. So that's why we decided to use the subsidy, to waive the annual fees and also give some reduced commissions in some of our business, but this is applied to all the merchants on our platform.\n\nAnd in terms of the free traffic. This is a very interesting question. I would say when we decided to give this support to the merchants, we have to consider the user experience on our platform, because we are a marketplace platform -- we are a marketplace, we are platform model, so we have to consider the interests of both merchants and consumers. So if we give free traffic to certain, I mean merchants, I think there, I mean they are operating with their conversion rate -- their click-through rate of the products may or may not be good enough to the customers. So that's why we don't want to do this one side efforts. So we have to ensure a good user experience on our platform, but at the same time we want to satisfy our merchants to release their financial pressure. So that's how we think about this, I mean, policy.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategic Investments\n\nYeah, let me supplement a little bit, Alicia. So for the subsidy and preferential commission rate, these are two separate things, subsidy we are talking about like waving of merchants annual fee on the Tmall platform that's the core during the COVID-19, right, so how it's going to help them to go through this difficult time and this preferential commission rate is ongoing efforts that we have this practice also this year. And to talk about either subsidy or preferential rates, I think our operational philosophy is that we're not a believer of just burning money to grow the GMV, we believe that whatever investment we make it should be supporting the sustainable growth rather than just burn and blow away the dollars.\n\nSo if you look at our profitability, this year, we're talking about somewhere over RMB140 billion and we have like $50 billion cash on our accounts. So they are money to invest, but we are emphasizing on helping merchants efficient and effective and sustainable way. Thanks.\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOperator. Last question.\n\nJoe Tsai -- Executive Chairman\n\n[Foreign Speech] [Foreign Speech]\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, thank you. Final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Mahaney -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. If you were to talk about the biggest structural changes, do you think that will occur to your business or to the digital economy because of the COVID-19 crisis, what would you say they are, you highlighted increased shopping for groceries online, but including that other things just step back, what do you think you're going to be the biggest structural changes, permanent changes in the way that consumers around the world interact digitally because of this crisis. Thank you very much.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay. I think on top of the new category penetration like the food and groceries, I think the other very important change is education and the customers who are not, I mean, a very, I mean experienced internal user or online shopper before COVID-19. So what we see is that during the pandemic many, many older people, they moved to online to buy everyday needs, and so it's not only about the category penetration, it's also about the user penetration. So we do see this change in the lifestyle of many, many people.\n\nAnd the second thing is not about consumption, it's about the change in the way of working and change in the way of education. So that's why in my remarks, I said our DingTalk experienced very, very robust growth during the quarter, up because of they become a very important platform of more people -- for working people who stick to the net and improve the working efficiencies and for students and schools, DingTalk became a very efficient platform for online classroom. So I think this is all about a change of lifestyle, change of the way of working, change of way of education. So this is a very, very fundamental -- these are very fundamental changes. I would say this will stay ever, I mean, even after the pandemic.\n\n[Foreign Speech]\n\nRon Lin -- Head, Investor Relations\n\nOkay. Thanks everyone for joining the call today.

Alibaba's gross merchandise volume broke $1 trillion as more merchants came online to use its digital sales platforms in the face of the coronavirus lockdown. Alibaba's cloud business, while still significantly smaller than its rival, Amazon, grew its revenue 58% YOY. The trend towards online shopping in our post-COVID-19 world is likely to provide Alibaba tailwinds.\n\nAll of this has been overshadowed by the passage of bill through by the U.S. Senate earlier this week that could lead to Alibaba, as well as many other Chinese companies, being de-listed from U.S. stock exchanges. The bill was passed in the wake of a scandal in which Nasdaq-listed Chinese firm Luckin Coffee, turned out to have been fabricating its sales numbers. The bill, if passed, would require all publicly-traded foreign companies to follow U.S. standards for audits and financial regulation, as well as reveal if they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.

(BABA), the giant online retail platform often called the Amazon.com of China, is bracing for the financial fallout from the worst global economic crisis in recent history. The coronavirus pandemic has caused a major downturn in Alibaba's key consumer markets, including China. Investors will focus on how these forces are affecting growth of Alibaba's annual active consumers, a key metric, when the company reports earnings on May 22, 2020 for Q4 2020 fiscal year (FY). The company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\ufeff\ufeff Analysts estimate that the company's adjusted net income will plunge amid slower growth in both revenue and annual active consumers.\n\nDespite crashing on fears of the spread of COVID-19, Alibaba's stock has rebounded and is currently outperforming the broader market. The company's shares have provided investors with a total return of 34.0% compared to the S&P 500's total return of 4.0% over the past 12 months.\ufeff\ufeff For this story, key Alibaba financial data have been converted from Renminbi to U.S. Dollars using a CNY/USD exchange rate of 0.140649 as of May 18, 2020.\n\nSource: TradingView.\n\nIn the most recent reported quarter, Alibaba posted adjusted net income growth of 51.9% for Q3 FY 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago. It was the company's second highest year-over-year (YOY) rate of growth in nine quarters. However, revenue rose just 37.7%, continuing a decelerating trend that began two quarters earlier and which marked the lowest YOY revenue growth in at least 15 quarters.\ufeff\ufeff Alibaba's shares fell slightly following the report before crashing on fears over the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhile the stock has rebounded, analysts expect one of the company's worst quarters in years. Adjusted net income is forecast to fall 23.2% YOY, marking the first decline in at least 16 quarters.

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. We have finished an extraordinary quarter and have delivered an outstanding fiscal year. Despite the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Alibaba achieved a historical milestone of USD 1 trillion in GMV across our digital economy this fiscal year, a strategic goal that we set for ourselves 5 years ago.\n\nWe at Alibaba have always been aiming for the stars while keeping our feet on the ground. The $1 trillion GMV milestone reflects the volatility of Alibaba's digital economy and as well as strong execution against the clear strategic vision. Our scale has now reached 1/6 of China's total retail sales, which was about USD 6 trillion last year. And we believe there is still tremendous potential of growth.\n\nDigital adoption and transformation in retail are accelerating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, reshaping consumer behavior and enterprise operations. On the consumer side, shopping online has become a habit for more people and in more product categories. On the retail side, online sales is no longer an option but a necessity for the brick-and-mortars. We believe that is the new normal that will stay ever -- stay even after the pandemic is over.\n\nI would like to review the past quarter's performance in the context of the impact and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 23 -- on January 23, right before the Chinese New Year holiday, China announced the lockdown of Wuhan, the center of the pandemic. The lockdown measures implemented in other provinces and cities led to large-scale economic disruption in late January and February, which negatively affected our domestic e-commerce business during the period.\n\nHowever, China quickly contained the pandemic by implementing measures such as strict social distancing, vaster testing coverage, centralized mobilization of medical resources and started to reopen the country for business in late February.\n\nBy March 9, China announced full recovery of logistics operation nationwide, except for Hubei Province where Wuhan is. And a normal life began to return for most of people in the country when Wuhan 10-week lockdown was lifted on April 8.\n\nSince March, we have seen a healthy recovery in our China retail marketplaces. As of March 31, 2020, annual active consumers on our China retail marketplaces reached 726 million, a net increase of 15 million versus the previous quarter. Mobile MAUs of our China retail marketplaces reached 846 million in March 2020, an increase of 22 million over December 2019. This reflects how our strong consumer mind share and healthy user stickiness.\n\nSince the new fiscal year began in April, the quarter-to-date paid GMV of our China retail marketplaces has experienced year-on-year growth at a similar rate to the December quarter's level. For the past several years, we have been investing to grow our new retail business in fresh food and grocery. Freshippo and Taoxianda, which have played an important role in supplying daily necessities to people impacted during the pandemic and have become widely popular among consumers. In the past quarter, both Freshippo and Taoxianda delivered stellar growth of more than 100% year-on-year. Approximately 60% of Freshippo's GMV came from online orders, up by 10 percentage points year-over-year.\n\nAs lockdown measures ease in China starting in April, demand and popularity of our grocery business have remained strong. We believe the consumer habit of buying fresh foods and groceries online will continue after the pandemic, and online and off-line integration will drive the new retail model to the next stage of development. We have been investing for years to build a new retail technology infrastructure, which will help us further strengthen our market leadership in this sector.\n\nAs a leading cross-border import platform in China, Tmall Global has become an ever more important destination for Chinese consumers to buy imported products as they could not travel abroad during the pandemic. In markets outside of China, our international retail marketplaces, such as Lazada and AliExpress, attracted over 180 million annual active consumers as of March 2020. Lazada's order volume grew by -- grew more than 100% year-on-year during the fiscal year and completed the March quarter with a strong finish despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During February and March 2020, our cross-border marketplace, AliExpress GMV, growth was negatively impacted, mainly by supply chain and the logistic disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We are seeing signs of recovery in certain major markets starting in April, but there are still uncertainties ahead.\n\nRevenue from our local consumer services business decreased by 8% year-on-year in the past quarter due to the impact of COVID-19. In April, year-on-year growth of our food delivery GMV turned positive as lockdown measures ease. Restaurants began reopening and people began returning to work in China. Alibaba Cloud continued its rapid growth in the past fiscal year with revenue reaching RMB 40 billion, an increase of 62% year-on-year.\n\nDuring pandemic, our public cloud business grew rapidly, driven by increased consumption of video content as well as wide adoption of remote working and learning. Our cloud computing infrastructure and big data business have also played a key role in enabling business to quickly resume operation and production. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate digital transformation of enterprises. All industries, including public sectors, will choose to move their technology infrastructure to the cloud.\n\nDingTalk, our digital collaboration platform for enterprises, played a key role during the pandemic. Millions more enterprise and users in China are now using DingTalk to stay connect and work remotely. DingTalk also made significant penetration in the education sector as schools adopt the platform for their teachers and students.\n\nIn March 2020, DingTalk conduct an average of over 1 million active classroom sections on each school day. DingTalk's number of daily average active consumers during working day grew significantly to 155 million in March. As offices and schools reopen in China, DingTalk's number of active users came down from the peak level but still maintain at more than 100 million DAU.\n\nIn the past quarter, our digital media and entertainment business delivered healthy growth in paying subscribers and the user time spent as users' consumption of video content increased significantly during the pandemic.\n\nYouku will continue its focus on production and distribution of original and exclusive content while ensuring cost efficiencies and return on investment.\n\nDuring the past quarter, we leveraged our platform technology and other resources across the Alibaba ecosystem to support population impacted by COVID-19 pandemic within China and around the world. We also implemented a comprehensive set of financial and business support measures to help alleviate the near-term challenge faced by our business customers and partners.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, Alibaba, together with Ant Financial, have contributed approximately RMB 3.4 billion in value in the form of donations, subsidies and tech support. To name a few examples, we waived fees, reduced commissions and offered logistics subsidies to our merchants. We work with Ant Financial and other partners to advance working capital funds to our merchants to provide liquidity and to facilitate 1-year loans with preferential interest rates. We used the RMB 1 billion special fund we established in January to procure medical and related supplies for parts of China affected by pandemic.\n\nOur logistics subsidiary, Cainiao, offered free delivery of medical supplies to destinations around the world through its extensive global logistic network. Our self-operated fresh food and grocery chain, Freshippo, committed to more than 200 remaining open for business even during a period when lockdown measures were in effect. Freshippo also worked with the supply chain to keep our commitment to not raising prices as well as maintaining adequate stock on the shelves. We made available AI technology to over 550 hospitals in China to help improving the speed and efficiency of the COVID-19 diagnosis during CT lung scans.\n\nThe Alibaba Foundation, through combined efforts with Jack Ma Foundation and the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation, donated over 200 million units of personal protective equipment, testing kits and ventilators to over 150 countries and regions.\n\nIn April 2020, we further announced the 2020 Spring Thunder initiative, which aims to help export-oriented SMEs, explore opportunities in the China domestic market through our China retail marketplaces and expand into new markets through our international wholesale and retail marketplaces such as alibaba.com and AliExpress to develop, digitalize manufacturing clusters, to accelerate the digital transformation of China's agricultural sector and alleviate financial -- financing challenge faced by SMEs by working with Ant Financial and its partners.\n\nThe battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is not over. Although China has made good progress in fighting and controlling the spread of the coronavirus, with most business reopening and people returning to normal life, the stretch of the pandemic is still looming in the rest of the world, and the timing and the pace of recovery is still uncertain. At the same time, tensions between the U.S. and China have added another layer of uncertainty to the post-COVID-19 world. Despite the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and the geopolitical environment, there is one thing we can certain. The world is moving towards digital-first and digital everything. In the past 2 decades, Alibaba has developed comprehensive infrastructure and the capabilities built on digital technology for business, financial services, logistics, cloud computing and big data to prepare for this new era. We believe our infrastructure and capabilities will play an important role in enabling all industries to embrace digital transformation and the customers to embrace a digital lifestyle.\n\nIn addition, we aim to empower SMEs around the world, including those in America, to access the Chinese and other global consumer markets and create new jobs. This is a hard work that Alibaba must undertake to fulfill our vision to make it easy to do this anywhere, and it is also the fundamental assurance for our sustainable growth in the future.\n\nNow I will turn it over to Maggie who will walk you through the details of our financial results.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWei Wu, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CFO & Head of Strategic Investments [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Daniel. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to start my prepared remarks by addressing COVID-19's impact on our financials and recent trends. Back in February, given the potential uncertainties of COVID-19 pandemic, we guided the market that our overall revenue growth rate would be negatively impacted for the March quarter and that some of the businesses, such as China retail marketplaces and local consumer services, might show negative revenue growth. I'm pleased to report we delivered better-than-expected March quarter results.\n\nThe government took effective measures to limit the spread of the virus through lockdown, social distancing measures and travel restrictions. With the virus spread under control in China, these restrictions started to ease in early March, and this led to a recovery of supply chain and logistics delivery capacity. This, in turn, enabled a quick recovery for our China retail marketplaces and improving fundamentals for local consumer service businesses.\n\nFor our China retail marketplaces, Tmall online physical goods, GMV, business paid GMV, grew 10% in the March quarter. Although only 10% growth, we did see robust demand of FMCG and the consumer electronics categories as homebound consumers cook at home and upgraded their home appliance and 3C products. These 2 categories combined grew 25% on our Tmall platform.\n\nOn the other hand, discretionary partner categories, such as apparel and accessories, home furnishing and auto parts, experienced negative growth. Starting in April, Tmall online physical goods GMV saw strong growth -- strong recovery and has continued to further improve in May. Local consumer services recorded 8% decline in revenue this quarter, reflecting mass closures of restaurants and local merchants. However, social distancing measures also led to increased demand for groceries and other daily necessities.\n\nStarting in April, GMV growth of food delivery businesses, Ele.me, turned positive as lockdown measures eased. Restaurants began reopening and people began returning to work in China. For our international commerce business, which represents around 7% of total revenue in fiscal 2020, the timing and pace of the recovery is still uncertain as demand in countries outside China may be further impacted by COVID-19.\n\nSo let's take a look at the March quarter financial highlights. Our total revenue of RMB 114 billion grew by 22% year-over-year. The increase was mainly driven by growth of the China commerce retail business, especially new retail businesses in grocery category and cloud computing. We continue to be successful at expanding product offerings on our platform that cater to the needs of different consumer segments.\n\nThe decrease of non-GAAP free cash flow was due to a one-off of AliExpress payment service restructuring. So this -- we had a full disclosure in our earnings release. This is mainly due to the overseas regulation requirement change, and AliExpress began the process of a restructure, so that it no longer holds consumer funds before they release to the merchants. That -- if we take that impact now, our non-GAAP free cash flow would have been over RMB 2 billion.\n\nLet's take a look at the revenue in detail. China commerce retail grew 21%. Customer management revenue grew 3%. The growth in customer management revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue from recommendation fees and Taobao life, these new revenue streams, partially offset by a decrease in volume of paid clicks and average unit price per click. These are the -- the paid click and PPC I'm talking about is for the search business, P4P. So this is impacted because of this COVID-19.\n\nCommission revenue decreased 2%, primarily due to effects of the COVID-19 impact. These impacts including cancellation of some orders as a result of logistic disruption in February, weakness in apparel categories, our waiver of annual service fees for the first half of 2020 as part of our support to merchant customers.\n\nInternational retail revenue grew 8% to RMB 5.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to the growth of Lazada and Trendyol and partially offset that exclusion of revenue from AliExpress Russia, which was no longer consolidated since October 2019. So we had a JV in Russia right now. Cainiao revenue reached to RMB 5 billion, growing at 28% year-on-year. This was primarily due to the increase in the volume of orders fulfilled from our fast-growing cross-border and international commerce retail businesses. And our local consumer service experienced a negative growth this quarter, I just talked about.\n\nSo for Ali Cloud, it's still growing strongly at 58%.\n\nAnd let's take a look at the March quarter cost trends. Cost of revenue, excluding SBC, was 62% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to a revenue mix shift towards their excess businesses, the new retail businesses, such as our new retail and also consolidation of Kaola and partially offset by decrease in delivery costs of our local consumer services.\n\nLet's turn to segment profitabilities. Our market-based core commerce adjusted EBITA reached CNY 34 billion, decreased 2%. But core commerce adjusted EBITA grew 2% to CNY 28 billion. This is because losses in our 4 strategic commerce initiatives were narrowed compared to prior year, driven by ongoing improvement of China logistic network, higher demand for Freshippo and the lower variable costs required for our local consumer service business.\n\nI would like to mention about the innovation initiatives. When you look at their adjusted EBITA loss was RMB 3.1 billion, which is up from CNY 1.9 billion from a year ago. The increase is primarily due to our aggressive investment in DingTalk to provide remote work collaboration capabilities to enterprises and schools free of charge during the COVID-19. As a result, daily active user in DingTalk achieved a fourfold increase to over 100 million. The peak of DAU is about 155 million.\n\nSo March quarter, other financial metrics. The share of results of equity investees in the quarter reached CNY 3.5 billion. The year-over-year increase in share of results of equity investees was mainly due to our share of profits in Ant Financial in December quarter as we take its profit in 1 quarter lag, partially offset by a decrease in our share of results of Suning.\n\nMarch quarter GAAP to non-GAAP net income. The GAAP net income attributed to shareholders was CNY 3.2 billion. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to net loss in investment income, mainly reflecting decreases in the market prices of our equity investments in publicly traded companies compared to net gain recorded in the same quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders increased by 12% to RMB 25 billion.\n\nNow let's look at the fiscal 2020 full year results. GMV. As Daniel mentioned, the Alibaba digital economy achieved an important milestone of USD 1 trillion GMV target. You probably remember that this is a target we committed to do 5 to 6 years ago.\n\nUser growth. Annual active consumers in China reached 780 million, including 726 million on our China retail marketplaces. In other words, 1 out of every 2 Chinese are buying on our platform. 780 million of annual active consumer in China accounts for around 85% and 40% of the Chinese population in developed and the less developed areas. Our ability to attract users at a rapid pace reflects not only the diversity of product selection but also the platform has become an every day destination for entertainment and discovery of new trends.\n\nWe continue to achieve strong revenue growth across all businesses, including core commerce, cloud computing and other businesses, so total revenue grew 35% to RMB 510 billion.\n\nHow about the profitability? In the last 12 months, we grew adjusted EBITA by 28% to RMB 137 billion and generated RMB 131 billion in non-GAAP free cash flow. This is significant firepower for our long-term growth.\n\nOkay. Let's turn to our business segment. All of the revenue we talked about for each sector showed strong growth. And then when you look at their adjusted EBITA, profit for the core are still growing strongly. And the investment areas that the new businesses in the investment stage are progressing very well, and loss gets narrowed.\n\nOkay. So I would like to talk about our outlook. But before that, I want to address the recent bill passed by the U.S. Senate called the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The proposed legislation would essentially prohibit a foreign issuer from being listed on U.S. Stock Exchange if the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, this is applicable, is unable to inspect all the work papers of the issuer's offices for 3 consecutive years due to certain reasons. We'll closely monitor the development of this bill, and I think it's important for investors to understand Alibaba's practice and issues raised under this proposed legislation.\n\nFirst, there is an existing framework of the pickup of contact of the PCAOB conduct -- of the PCAOB and -- for its conduct and inspection of audits of companies with Chinese operations. In this regard, we understand that there has been ongoing dialogue among the big 4 accounting firms, Chinese securities regulator, CSRC, SEC and PCAOB with respect to the types of information that are permitted to be exchanged on issuers with Chinese operations while maintaining compliance with Chinese laws.\n\nNumber two, Alibaba's financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. And since our inception in 1999, we have been audited by PwC Hong Kong. PwC Hong Kong is the local affiliate of the worldwide PwC firm, and its auditing standards are overseen by the PwC national office in the United States. The integrity of Alibaba's financial statements speaks for itself. We have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the high standard of transparency. Each year, we have received an unqualified or the opinion on our financial statements from PWC.\n\nThird, trust is one of our core values, and transparency and integrity are essential components of building trust with all of our stakeholders. All these years, we have consistently aimed to grow the business for long term, maintain compliance with all applicable laws and deliver value for our customers, employees and investors. Investors who bought our stock in 2014 IPO have tripled their investment over the past 5.5 years. Given the above, we will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. Stock Exchanges.\n\nLooking ahead, despite a challenging quarter due to pandemic, we achieved our guidance of over CNY 500 billion in revenue and delivered healthy, sustainable profit growth in fiscal year 2020. The reason we have been able to deliver these results is that we see years ago by investing in technology, in innovation and in businesses that require foresight and long-term patience. Today, the Alibaba digital economy remains strong and growing.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue the same strategy of delivering robust revenue growth and sustainable profit growth. Although it is difficult to predict the uncertainty of global economic and geopolitical developments, based on our current view of Chinese domestic consumption and enterprise digitization, we expect to generate over RMB 650 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2021.\n\nWe believe our commitment to invest and deepen our value proposition to customers, thereby, ensuring robust revenue and profit growth.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open for Q&A. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRobert Lin, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - IR [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThank you, Maggie. Hi, everyone. So for today's call, you are welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English. Our third-party translator later will provide consecutive interpretation for the Q&A session. As our management will address your questions in the language you asked, please note that the translation is for convenience purpose only. In the case of any discrepancies, our management statements in the original language [will prevail].\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [6]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo operator, I'd like to open it up for questions.\n\n================================================================================\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [1]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Binnie Wong from HSBC.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWai Yan Wong, HSBC, Research Division - Head of Internet Research of Asia Pacific & Analyst [2]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] My question is regarding your strategy in lower-tier cities. I know that last week, you issued a new release -- a new patch release for Taobao, providing new support for merchants as well as other new features, and 70% of the uptake for that new patch release, in fact, been from the lower-tier cities. So if you could speak to us about your strategy going forward for the lower-tier cities.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [3]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you, and I will take that question. Given the size and the scale of Taobao as a retail platform and where it's at today, 700 million, the fact is that we've penetrated all segments of the market from the high end down to the low. And the increase in the user base over the past year, 70 million, 70% of that came from the lower-tier cities.\n\nThank you. So what we're doing in the lower-tier cities is deploying a more diverse and broad range of different services, including on Taobao with more value for money offerings as well as live streaming and other kinds of engagement that are targeted for those users, especially those who are looking for a good value for money. And as you've noted, we have a new special price edition of Taobao, which is targeted for those users in lower-tier cities with a focus on giving them value for money offerings.\n\nAt the same time, we see significant potential for further growing our user base. The current figure for annual active consumers, 780 million, represents only 45 penetration -- 45% penetration of the population in lower-tier cities and in the rural areas of China. So there still is lots of room to grow in those regions, and we intend to do so together with Alipay in driving a digitalization strategy in those areas that will convert people into consumers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [4]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Bank of America.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEddie Leung, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD in Equity Research and Analyst [5]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] My question is regarding the long-term impact of live streaming on the industry and in particular, celebrity hosts and KOL live streaming. The question is if merchants need to pay these celebrities, these KOLs, will that impact on the profitability of platforms going forward?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [6]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you. And that's a really good question. What we're seeing really is the emergence of live streaming as a new kind of sales methodology or a new kind of sales channel. With the emergence of these KOLs and celebrity influencers online, the role that they're really playing in the context of retail is sales. They're serving as salespeople, and they make money by way of a sales commission.\n\nIn the long term, how this trend will play out I think really comes down to whether the intrinsic commercial value in terms of having online influences and KOLs through live streaming be fully captured in an efficient and effective way. If you have a one-off sales event with a celebrity influencer, you get a user to make a one-off purchase, that's fine. But the question is, can you then keep that user in the long-term and continue to market to them and get the full value out of that relationship? So I think it's important if you're paying money to these online influencers or celebrities that you convert -- in part, that's about supplanting existing channel costs and saving costs there. But more importantly, it's about getting the new consumer into your ecosystem so they can become a long-term consumer. And this is critical to Alibaba because we are a diversified ecosystem with multiple channels and formats for engaging consumers. So that's precisely what we're looking at doing with these kinds of live streaming approaches. It's just one part of an overall integrated approach to which we hope to develop with long-term relationships and create long-term value.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [7]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiyush Mubayi, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD [8]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have one question with regards to the guidance you provided for next year. What are the drivers of that growth assumption or guidance you provided? And in particular, what are the underlying macro assumptions you've made? And more generally, the platform mix that you like -- to the 1P versus 3P mix that you're likely to see that's underpinning that guidance? I'll go back to the queue afterwards. [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWei Wu, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CFO & Head of Strategic Investments [9]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiyush, this is Maggie. Let me try to answer your question. So we all know that we're facing risks and uncertainties, right? So many of which we're not able to predict or control. So whether there's going to be a second wave or when will that vaccine come, how much impact will the geopolitical issue bring, we -- it's hard for us to factor in.\n\nSo the guidance we gave basically reflects assumptions that we believe to be reasonable today. So Daniel talked about the recovery speed of each of our businesses and particularly for like China retail, local service and international business, et cetera. So based on what we've seen today and we see this quarter-to-date transaction volume and also user activities, et cetera, has already experienced a similar growth at a similar rate to the December quarter level. So that's basic assumption that we used.\n\nAnd you mentioned about 1P, 3P. So you can see from our revenue breakdown sort of 2020 fiscal year, 1P business as a percentage of the total revenue already went up to around 15%, 16%, and we believe that percentage is going to continue to go up but not systematically. But the important thing is that people are thinking about your revenue contains bigger portion of 1P. The 1P normally represents low margin. But look at our profit growth. I think this is another point I want to make is that we are a group that has such a strong growth for the core. And also, as a multiple engine, not only (inaudible) Tmall, the China retail marketplace, but also [cars] in new retail, local services logistics, right? So strong revenue growth brings in the powder for us to invest in those strategically important areas. And these investment areas, they are doing better and better, which reflects into our office growth.

Yao, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Head of Asia Internet and New Media Research [11]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you. I noted in the earlier remarks your comments about advertising revenue in the first quarter performing well, driven by good performance of recommendation fees. And in that context, I'd like to ask about your plans for monetization of recommendations. I imagine that in your answer, you'll talk about the need to balance the interest of merchants against the desire for monetization. So given that, perhaps I could go ahead and just ask the second part of the question, namely, is there any technical or technological method that could be adopted, on the one hand, so as to fully protect the merchant's interest so we can better serve the merchant's interest while, at the same time, also providing more opportunity for monetization? And if so, is that something that could happen this year?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [12]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you. Well, I'll start with the latter part of your question, and the answer is, yes, there is technology that can do precisely that. And the technology is AI, artificial intelligence, which can be applied, and we are already working on applying it in a way that can ensure a good user experience in terms of balancing advertising content versus free content for users and also leveraging that technology for merchants to drive better return on their investment. So we're working in this direction, and I think we're already making good progress. So in general, we are moving forward cautiously in working on growing revenues from recommendation fees. And there's a hope that we can find ever better ways to do precisely what you mentioned in your question, mainly finding the best possible balance, leveraging on technology between user experience and creating value for merchants.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWei Wu, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CFO & Head of Strategic Investments [13]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you. I'd just like to add a couple of points on top of Daniel's already very clear answer. And the keyword I'd like to add in is multi-engine approach. So if you look at our revenue over this 3-year period, revenue from CMR and commissions accounted for 70% compared against 40%. And what this means is that our strategic investments are starting to produce new channels of revenue, new sources of revenue. So you can see this in our figures over the 3-year period for CMR as well, 90%, and that's down now by 20% to about 70%. So you have all of these different new revenue areas that can be tapped into, including recommendations that we've talked about, but also live streaming, also [Xinyu] and many other new sources of revenue. So thirdly and in conclusion, going forward, yes, we will continue, as we said on Investor Day, to take a prudent approach in moving forward with monetization.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [14]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from Jefferies.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThomas Chong, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst [15]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy question is more about the spending power of the buyers post virus. Can management comment about the overall spending power of consumers these days? And with that, can you comment about the trend in ASP and all the frequency that we would expect as people speeding up the migration to online? [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [16]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. Let me answer this question. First of all, I think on our platform, we are such a huge consumer platform. We have different tiers of consumers around us. So what we see is that consumers, they engage with us and find what they want in different categories in the different pricing range. While we do see some shift of the product categories in this quarter because of the pandemic, for example, we see a very strong growth of food and grocery business. And because people -- when people stay at home, they have to cook at home. They don't -- they are unable to go to the restaurant, so they need more food and more groceries, which are all daily necessities. So that's why we see very strong growth in our FMCG categories and food categories. Our FMCG categories grow like, take for example, like in starting from the new fiscal year, our FMCG categories in Tmall can grow nearly like 40 -- I remember, 40% -- around 40%, which is a very strong indicator that people spend more on our platform in these categories.\n\nWell, because of the pandemic, people spend less on like apparel, like a fashion because people wear facemasks, and they don't even need these makeups. So I think the spend is still there, but the focus are quite different. And -- but in terms of the general spending power, I would say,different. China is a famous high-saving rate country. And we do see people remain in their consumption -- remaining a very strong consumption power to continue their -- to maintain their lifestyle. So we do -- so far, we haven't seen any big change in terms of the consumption power. But as I said before, I think the category -- the product categories, they try, and we do see some difference.\n\nLet me clarify one point. When we talk about beauty, what we see is like skin care still remain very strong. But for makeup, because of -- as I said, when ladies wear facemasks, they may -- the need for makeup are getting lower. So that's [setting] the situation. [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [17]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJason Stuart Helfstein, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst [18]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI just want to go a little bit deeper into that last point. You said that online physical goods GMV grew 10%, and then you did break down that you saw 25% in these categories that benefited were more COVID-related, offset by areas where they didn't spend money. What do you think is a kind of more reflective of the consumer health? Is it that 10% number? Or really, is it that kind of 25% and consumers have the ability right now to spend more, they're just not because they don't need the items consistent to what you talked about not needing makeup if you're wearing a mask, for example? And maybe talk about how that relates to your outlook for the next quarter. [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [19]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. Let me answer this question. As we said before, our China retail -- our Tmall grow like 10% in the March quarter. And in Tmall, we have our FMCGs and consumer electronics. The combined growth rate in March quarter for these categories on Tmall is about -- was about 25%. If you want to get a big picture of the future development, I think in my remarks, I gave you a very clear latest indicator, which is, I think, starting from the new year. In terms of the quarter-to-date, overall speaking, our [primary] retail marketplace growth rate is similar to those in December quarter. So I think that that's basically the big picture of where we are today.\n\nAnd as we do -- all people we realize, understand that there is still uncertainties about the containing the pandemic. So we are closely monitoring the situation. But we strongly believe that the consumption power in China is still very strong and that we will take our advantage in the digital platform to continue our leading position.\n\nYes. Let me add one more point, which is like if you look at the past fiscal year, our -- we generate USD 1 trillion GMV within our -- in Alibaba ecosystem. But if you look at our China retail marketplaces, the GMV we generated last fiscal year is about like RMB 6.5 trillion. And we -- if we look at the -- if we look at what happened in the March quarter, I think we should have achieved a higher GMV without this pandemic, obviously. And -- but if -- but we are very confident that in the new year, I think we will achieve another like net adds of like 1 trillion -- at least RMB 1 trillion GMV in our China retail marketplace, which is, I think, a still very strong number compared to the size of our business in China. [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [20]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext question comes from the line of Gregory Zhao from Barclays.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXiaoguang Zhao, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - VP [21]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] And congratulations on the strong performance. My question relates to cloud services. We know that internationally, players like Microsoft and Google who have already achieved significant scale in terms of their size and their revenues continue to be able to maintain rapid growth in the revenues and even acceleration. Looking at China, however, in the cloud space, Alibaba and its competitors seem to be seeing a different trend where things are somewhat slower. So I'm wondering if you could compare for us please the China market versus the international market for cloud. What are the differences underlying that picture? And what are the short-term bottlenecks? And how would it be possible potentially to make a big leap forward in terms of accelerating revenue and profit growth in cloud?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [22]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Interpreted] Thank you. Well, first, I'd like to say that in the past year, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence is a very important milestone, namely reaching revenue of $40 billion and even in the March quarter, achieving 58% growth. So we don't see a slowdown at all. Conversely, we think that the growth is good.\n\nWe see this growth coming from several different areas. One is the demand across all sectors of the economy to get on to the cloud. And if you look at Chinese IT spending in the future, we can expect to see more and more spending going forward as the organizations get themselves on the cloud.\n\nThe second thing I would point to is that the cloud is not just a way of providing infrastructure on the cloud to lower IT-related operating costs. It's also an opportunity for companies to leverage on big data and cloud-enabled computing capacity to achieve better efficiencies and drive value for the business. And different kinds of algorithms and analytics will be developed in the cloud for different sectors, for different verticals, different product solutions to meet those needs and unleash real value for them. So it's not just about saving costs on IT infrastructure. It's about driving value as well.\n\nIn Ali, we value proposition. What we offer is cloud plus intelligence. So we're not just about providing cloud services. It's a combination of cloud plus intelligence. Now in different countries, cloud services are defined differently. It's true in China and internationally as well, there are different definitions. But to us, if it's just about shifting traffic on to the cloud to save costs of kind of a low value-added offering, and that's not really what Alibaba is about, we're looking at focusing on higher value-added, cloud-enabled offerings that can truly create value for clients in different sectors.\n\nAnd finally, on your question as to the differences that we see in the Chinese cloud market versus the cloud market overseas, I would say that in the U.S. and in other more developed markets, the SaaS and the whole ecosystem developers are more mature already, whereas in China, that developer ecosystem in soft. It's just starting to get going. And Alibaba very much looks forward to partnering with developers to jointly create a very robust ecosystem in China.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOperator [23]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYik Wah Yap, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Head of Pan-Asia Internet Research [24]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCongrats on the strong results. My question is on -- so if you could give us some colors that on the subsidy measure that you help provide merchants, do you think that is actually more effective to the commission rebate or merchants that will prefer more free traffic? And given recommended feeds are actually becoming quite effective for merchants, so does that mean over the next few quarters, we don't have to provide more preferential commission rate over time? Or is that is a separate thing and the CMR commission growth direction will still be a bit diverged? [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [25]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlicia, let me first answer your question. I think, first of all, we are trying to help our merchants, especially SMEs, during this pandemic. But we have to -- first of all, we have to give a very fair and transparent policy to all the merchants on our platform. So that's why we decided to use the subsidy to waive the annual fees and also give some reduced commissions in some of our business, but this is applied to all the merchants on our platform.\n\nAnd in terms of the free traffic, this is a very interesting question. I would say, when we decided to give this support to the merchants, we have to consider the user experience on our platform because we are a marketplace platform -- we are a marketplace. We are a platform model. So we have to consider the interest of both merchants and consumers. So if we give free traffic to certain merchants, I think their -- operating their conversion rate -- their click-through rate of the product may or may not be good enough to the customers. So that's why we don't want to do this one-size effort. So we have to ensure a good user experience on our platform. But at the same time, we want to share -- we want to certify our merchants to release their financial pressure. So that's how we think about these policies. [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWei Wu, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CFO & Head of Strategic Investments [26]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. Let me supplement a little bit, Alicia. So for the subsidy and preferential commission rates, these are 2 separate things. Subsidy, we're talking about like waiving of merchants annual fee and Tmall platform. That's a support during COVID-19, right, to help them to go into this difficult time. And this preferential commission rate is ongoing efforts that we have this package all through this year.\n\nAnd talk about either subsidy or preferential rate, I think our operational philosophy is that we're not a believer of just burning money to grow the GMV. We believe that whatever investment we make, it should be the -- supporting the sustainable growth rather than just burn and slow away the dollars.\n\nSo if you look at our profitability, right, this year, we're talking about somewhere over RMB 140 billion, and we have like USD 50 billion cash on our accounts. So they are money to invest, but we are emphasizing on helping merchants in efficient and effective and sustainable way. Thanks.

Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst [28]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you were to talk about the biggest structural changes you think that will occur to your business or to the digital economy because of the COVID-19 crisis, what would you say they are? You highlighted the increased shopping for groceries online. But including that, other things, just step back, what do you think are going to be the biggest structural changes, permanent changes in the way that consumers around the world interact digitally because of this crisis? [Interpreted]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYong Zhang, Alibaba Group Holding Limited - CEO & Executive Chairman [29]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay. I think on top of the new category penetration like in the food and groceries, I think more important -- the other very important change is the education and the penetration in the customers who are not a very experienced Internet user or online shoppers before COVID-19. For example, what we see is that during the pandemic, many, many other people, they move to online and buy everything they need. And so it's not only about a category penetration. It's also about the user penetration. So we do see this change the lifestyle of many, many people.\n\nAnd the second thing is not about consumption. It's about a change in way of working and a change in way of education. So that's why in my remarks, I said that our DingTalk experienced a very, very robust growth during the quarter because of -- they become a very important platform for people -- for working people to stay connect and to improve their working efficiencies. And for students and schools, DingTalk become a very efficient platform for online classroom. So I think this is all about change of the lifestyle, change of the way of working, change of way of education. So this is a very, very fundamental -- but these are very fundamental changes. I would say this will stay ever -- even after the pandemic.
